","In a Cassava field just outside Kabunjwiri, a small village in the Gisagara district in rural Rwanda, Claudine is finishing the last stages of harvesting before the rainy season begins in April. She works 8-10 hours a day in the field, and spends another 4-6 hours cooking and doing house chores. Across sub-Saharan Africa, women produce up to 80% of foods for household consumption and sale in local markets, according to a report by the World Bank and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Women sow the seeds, do the weeding, cultivate and harvest the crops, while they also tend to the aftermath of farming as they sell surpluses in local markets. But despite their indisputable contribution to agriculture in the continent, the gender gap is very noticeable in the sector. Women own less than 1 percent of lands. In the Ethiopian coffee market, for example, women provide 75 per cent of the labor but earn only 34 percent of total income generated.,Agriculture is only one example of the ever present gender inequality that is extremely dominant across Africa. According to the African Development Bank and the UN, the continent’s Gender Equality Index ranges from 24.0% to 79.7%, averaging at 48.6%, while the rest of the world stands at 68.6%.,At work, at home, and in school, inequality is all around,When looking at the labour force, Africa scores ahead of other regions and continents on women’s labour-force participation, but 89.7 percent of employed women work in low-paid jobs in the informal sector, leaving them little hope for advancement, higher wages, or promotions. And while the continent has the highest female representation on company boards of any region, standing at 25 percent (the global average is 17 percent), the share of women in middle management has regressed by 1 percent a year since 2015. Only 15% of formal-sector firms have a woman as the managing director, while 32% have some degree of female ownership. Women account for more than 50 percent of Africa’s combined population, but in 2018 generated only 33 percent of the continent’s collective GDP.,Unpaid care work, including child and elderly care, house chores and more, continues to fall disproportionately on women’s shoulders, as they bear the burden of Africa’s infrastructure deficit. The lack of access to the most basic services, especially power and water, is the main problem, as women and girls spend up to 20 hours a week collecting firewood and water, which over the course of a year, can represent up to two months of labour.,In terms of education, finance, and technology women are left far behind, with financial inclusion steadily declining since 2017. In terms of education, there is progress in primary level parity between girls and boys, but it is non-existent in the secondary level, as most of the girls are still pulled out of school to help with house chores and labour. Women are 34 percent less likely than men to have a smartphone, hindering potential adoption of digital solutions.,In general, Women and girls carry most of the care and domestic burden, are not likely to be employed in the formal sector or earn high wages, do not have access to financial services, and lack proper education levels that could change this predicament.,Despite the vast inequality, women are very active as economic agents, performing the majority of agricultural activities, owning a third of all businesses, and determining the welfare of their families and the life prospects of their children. According to McKinsey,  Africa could add $316 billion or 10 percent to GDP in the period to 2025 if each country makes advances in women’s equality to match the country in the region that has achieved the most progress towards parity. However, At the current rate of progress, Africa could take more than 140 years to achieve gender parity.,The only way forward,As with many other issues and sectors regarding Africa’s needed development, technological advancements could lead entire communities to leapfrog the current gloom situation, and reach a more equal reality. Various solutions are already out there, and many more are currently under development, with COVID19 accelerating innovation in multiple remote fields.,Solar energy and off-grid solutions are the perfect fit for hundreds of millions who are living without infrastructure in their villages and homes, and are already saving women and girls vast amounts of time that was previously spent on house chores including the procurement of combustible fuels, cooking on an open fire, and more. The light is also helping girls spend more time doing school work, as they are finally able to study after dark. As solar energy becomes more accessible across the continent, millions of women are expected to enjoy power in coming years, and according to a recent report by IRENA, sub-Saharan Africa could meet up to 67 percent of its energy needs by 2030, which could prove to be extremely meaningful for gender equality in the region.,Education is getting an added boost from multiple remote services and edtech companies that reach girls everywhere, allowing them to receive global education and gain important skills. In recent years, mobile money providers across the region began offering educational content and made big advancements in the field. According to Markets and Research, the e-learning market is expected to reach $1.8 billion USD by 2024, and COVID19-related lockdowns have established an even greater cause for speeding up development.,Fintech solutions are abundant across Africa, with mobile money in the lead, and other crypto-based, and digital services taking the continent by storm, presenting women with financial inclusion for the first time ever. Digital solutions not only create new opportunities for women to open bank accounts, which was previously limited by cultural and regulatory difficulties, but also allows traveling to long distances without the worry of carrying cash, providing more opportunities to get out of rural areas. A study done in Kenya checking the long-term effects of mobile money found that approximately 185,000 in the country women moved from agriculture to small-scale retail as a result, leading to a higher income and better opportunities for advancement.,Internet connectivity plays a major role in allowing access to these important advancements, and inventive technologies including TV White Space and satellite broadband are providing millions with access, while new ventures alongside the biggest companies in the world including Facebook and Microsoft are working to reach millions more solutions.,It has long been recognized that investing in women and girls is one of the most effective ways of promoting development. Educated women are far more likely to have fewer children, and higher means to provide for them, and the resulting improvement has multiplier effects that expand with each generation. Studies have also found that each year of additional schooling for girls reduces infant mortality by 5-10%, and the children of mothers with five years of primary education are 43% less likely to be malnourished. This is meaningful everywhere, and particularly for a continent expected to double its population in the coming decade. Hopefully, innovative thinkers will continue paving the path to an equal, fair future for all.",business

","Experts and dealers in cooling appliances have said that thousands of consumers ought to switch to energy-efficient and climate-friendly refrigerators and air conditioners to help Rwanda implement Amendment to cut production of Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) that are said to be powerful climate-warming gases.,The 2016 Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol which entered into force in 2019 is an international treaty designed to phase out such powerful climate-warming gases by more than 80 percent in the next 30 years.,Once phased out, the gases could reduce 0.5 degrees Celsius of global warming.,Jean Paul Nsengiyumva, the proprietor of Cold Air Ltd that deals in the appliances told Doing Business that there exists cooling appliances on the domestic market which have both environmental and economic benefits.,“Besides consuming less electricity, they do not pollute the air. Going by an example, if someone used to spend 200 grams of cooling gas, the energy-efficient appliances spend around 80 grams. This means that the less cooling gas used, the less power is consumed,” he said.,Aline Uwase, a restaurant owner in Kigali city said that the old fridge she uses consumes half of the power the whole business consumes.,“The government decision to embrace energy-saving cooling appliances is timely. However, there should be a financing mechanism to help people switch to energy-efficient refrigerators because the upfront cost is high. ,Some people do not have knowledge about this energy-saving and climate-friendly refrigerators,” she said.,According to the domestic refrigerating appliance and room air conditioner market and feasibility assessment by Rwanda Cooling Finance Initiative (RCOOL FI), there has been a steady increase in refrigerators in the residential sector since 2012 with an estimated stock of 97,512 refrigerators owned by households in Rwanda as of last year.,Although most of the refrigerators found in households are new with 58.6 per cent bought less than three years ago, there is 36 per cent which are approximately 35,104 households who purchased their refrigerating appliances over four years ago and may still use powerful climate-warming gases.,The largest market potential for refrigerators is in Kigali city, followed by the Southern Province, the Western Province, the Eastern Province, and finally the Northern Province while the air conditioners market at the household level in Rwanda is relatively small.,Also, the findings indicate that the best potential residential market segments are middle-income households with about 66.3 per cent market share- and high-income households with controlling about 23.2 per cent of the market share including micro-entrepreneurs from urban areas controlling about 26.9 per cent.,However, the study revealed there are some financial and technical barriers that would need to be addressed to accelerate the transformation of the market towards energy-efficient cooling equipment.,It shows that some of the barriers affecting household clients in adopting energy efficient refrigerators particularly those who already have old appliances is the high upfront cost.,There is also the aspect of lack of trust that the product will achieve energy as well as lack of awareness on energy savings in the long run.,Technology suppliers, it indicates, face the challenge of financing energy-efficient cooling equipment because they lack suitable financing.,Air conditioners market in Rwanda is less than 30 percent according to studies.,However, 42.3 per cent of suppliers are optimistic that with the introduction of a new financial mechanism, this trend may shift to between 30 and 40 per cent.,The 42.3 per cent of the respondents said that the current market penetration of refrigerator in Rwanda ranges between 61 and 70 per cent but believe with the introduction of a financial mechanism market penetration can increase to between 70 and 80 per cent.,In order to ensure the appliances are energy-efficient and climate-friendly, the National Green Growth and Climate Resilience strategy for climate change and low carbon development and National Cooling strategy are among the potential tools to reduce powerful climate-warming gases used in cooling appliances.,To cut the consumption of powerful climate-warming gases used in cooling appliances, Rwanda has drastically reduced, by 54%, the importation of gases known as ‘hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs)’ that deplete the ozone layer paving the way for implementing the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol.,Martine Uwera, the National Focal Point of Montreal Protocol, recently told Doing Business that Rwanda has reduced the importation of chlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) from 4.1 tonnes in 2010 to 1.89 tonnes currently.,The green growth strategy also highlights that implementation of low energy consumption standards in buildings and services in Rwanda could result in an 80 per cent reduction in energy use.,Studies show that old refrigerators that are not energy-efficient consume an estimated Rwf4 billion power annually of which Rwf2.4bn is an expense that could be saved.",business

Often, there are registration fees or initial investment for new members received by the organization.  The initial members receive hefty payouts from fees of people in lower ranks rather than the selling of services or products.,You are forced to buy other things you don’t want or need just to stay in good standing with the organization or to receive promotions.,It is common for pyramid schemes to seek to inspire new members through testimonies of the lavish and prosperous lives of initial members in a bid to entice new members to be actively involved in promotional activities. Others boast of having global renowned celebrities as their members in a bid to portray the entities as legitimate. The phrase, “even so and so is our member” is not uncommon in pyramid scheme recruitment process.,The pitches and presentations made to attract members are often largely about prosperity, riches, fortunes and accomplished dreams as opposed to business opportunities and models to be used.,It is not uncommon for new recruits to leave feeling inspired and motivated after the presentation but uncertain about the entity’s business model and approach.,When one conducts due diligence, it is not uncommon to find that the said firm runs business activities in aspects that it is not registered under.

https://www.newtimes.co.rw/business/covid-19-vaccine-rollout-across-africa-dire-need-larger-momentum,"Covid-19 vaccine rollout across Africa is in dire need of a larger momentum
","This month, Rwanda became the first country in Africa to roll-out the Pfizer-BionTech Covid-19 vaccine, with the help of COVAX. Alongside vaccines arriving in Ghana in late February, this marks the beginning of the continuous efforts of local and international governments together with global organisations and various donors, all trying to find creative solutions for the continent’s vast vaccination needs that are currently far from being met.,According to the Economist Intelligence Unit, Africa, like many other developing countries, will not be able to vaccinate health workers, older population, and other vulnerable groups before 2023, and this timeline could extend to 2025 for universal coverage. Therefore, the continent may suffer vastly from the pandemic’s socioeconomic impacts due to challenges around vaccine access.,Around the world, socioeconomic effects can be witnessed in multiple areas and sectors, and Africa, albeit the relatively low numbers of cases, is no different. The pandemic caused an estimated 6.1 per cent fall in per-capita income in 2020 and is expected to lead to a further 0.2 per cent decline in 2021, setting average living standards back by a decade or more in a quarter of Sub-Saharan African economies. According to the World Bank, tens of millions are expected to be pushed into extreme poverty.,For oil exporters such as Angola, Nigeria, and South Africa, Covid’s impacts aggravated a crisis that began in 2015, with commodity prices falling, global lockdowns resulted in reduced exports for other commodities including iron, cotton, coffee and sugar, travel restrictions have halted tourism and hospitality industries across the continent, and strict national lockdowns since have affected small businesses.,To reach herd immunity and kick start the economy, Africa needs 1.5 billion vaccines, and global efforts to reach that goal are mounting. The most meaningful initiative is currently COVAX, bringing together governments, global health organisations, manufacturers, scientists, private sector, civil society and philanthropy, with the aim of providing vaccines to people in all corners of the world, regardless of their wealth. The facility was the first to deploy vaccines across the continent, with Rwanda, Ghana, and Côte d’Ivoire being the first countries to begin vaccinating their health workers. The African Union has secured 270 million vaccine doses from a mix of sources including Pfizer and BioNTech, Oxford University and AstraZeneca, and Johnson & Johnson. But alongside global and local efforts, challenges are still vast.,Even with hundreds of millions of doses secured by the various entities, wide scale vaccine distribution in Sub-Saharan Africa is facing multiple obstacles, as infrastructure, as always, is insufficient across sectors. Poor transport and distribution systems, weak health systems, and insufficient cold storage systems are a few to name. Widespread distrust is another concern, as vast parts of the population are afraid to get the jab. The cost is another major issue, expected to reach $8-16 billion, with an additional markup of 20-30 percent for program delivery.,There are a number of issues to tackle in the path of reaching adequate vaccination rates across the continent:,Covax participation: today, almost half of Africa’s 55 countries are participating in the COVAX facility. Participation should grow to strengthen pooled bargaining power and ensure wider access to the global vaccine supply.,Secure other paths for vaccines: COVAX promised access to vaccines for up to 20% of participating countries’ population. As herd immunity currently requires at least 60% of the population to be vaccinated, countries across the continent must look for other ways to access more doses, including direct agreements with big pharma producers, and national R&D.,Allocate more funds to in house Research: in a recently published Covid-19 Vaccine Development and Access Strategy, the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) set accelerating local involvement in research and development as the leading key objective. Today, only 2% of clinical trials conducted worldwide occur in Africa. Investments in research and development will ultimately lead to increased efficacy of vaccines for populations across the continent, as can be seen in India. For example, Nigerian laboratory announced the development of a 90% effective vaccine back in September in the preclinical trial but it has not been able to carry out clinical trials due to lack of support and funding.,Invest in rural infrastructure: in rural, last-mile communities, as well as in large cities across the SSA region, electricity is unreliable, and often non-existent, leaving solar power as the only path to reach full immunisation. Added efforts should be taken to fast-track deployment of off-grid solar electrification solutions, with a focus on local healthcare centers that could use the power to properly store vaccines. Since 2018, and long before Covid was ever an issue, UNICEF, alongside local governments and Gavi, began buying and installing solar-powered vaccine-storage fridges throughout the region, supporting vaccination efforts for various diseases.,Finally, continued global support is crucial in reaching adequate immunisation rates. Wealthy countries and donor organizations must continue their support, while private companies working across the continent should ramp up efforts to expand solar solutions, last mile delivery technologies, and cold storage devices.,The road to Covid eradication is still long, and Africa is facing a longer path than most. With focused efforts on multiple accounts millions of lives can be saved., The writer is an entrepreneur and investor, leading sustainability-driven companies in Africa and the Middle East",business

https://www.newtimes.co.rw/business/oecds-updated-guidance-tax-treaties-and-impact-covid-19,"OECD’s updated guidance on tax treaties and the impact of Covid-19
","The Covid-19 pandemic has impacted every part of our lives – tax treaties have not been immune to this impact.,Earlier this year, the OECD issued updated guidance on the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on tax treaties. This guidance is intended to provide further certainty to taxpayers as it reiterates most of its original guidance issued in April 2020, a few months after the pandemic broke out.,A number of countries have also issued their own guidance to provide certainty to taxpayers who could be impacted by their own tax treaties or domestic tax legislation – most countries have followed the OECD guidance.,The guidance applies only to situations arising during the pandemic and it is, therefore, temporary in nature, seeking to avoid instances of double taxation whilst ensuring that it is not relied upon to create instances of double non-taxation.,1. The creation of a permanent establishment (‘PE’) and the interruption of construction sites;,2. Changes in residence for entities and individuals;,3. Income from employment.,The main theme of these guidelines is that, in view of the fact these changes are exceptional and temporary, they should not create adverse tax consequences for the taxpayer. This may be seen in the ‘Home Office’ section of the guidance which states that in order for a home office to be deemed to be a PE, it must have a degree of permanence and be at the disposal of the enterprise. The ‘degree of permanence’ will not be met if the home office has simply been created as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, as individuals working from home are typically doing so as a result of public health emergencies.,However, it is likely that a number of companies will allow employees to work from home even once the pandemic is over. One needs to look at the facts and circumstances of each case to determine whether such home office will result in a PE for the enterprise post-Covid 19, as this could result in a material tax consequences for the enterprise.,A matter of great concern is also the impact that the pandemic will have on the tax residence of companies, in view of the travel restrictions which have been imposed which do not allow board members or senior executives to travel to the company’s typical place of residence. In view of the fact that the change in location of board members or senior executives is extraordinary and temporary, this will unlikely result in any changes to the company’s tax residence status under a treaty.,A similar general conclusion is discussed for concerns relating to the residence status of individuals. Here again, it is unlikely that such a temporary change could result in a change in the tax residence of the individual as a result of applying the tie-breaker rules.,As mentioned, each case should be looked into separately depending on the specific facts and circumstances and taking into consideration any specific guidance issued by the country in question on the impact of the pandemic on tax matters.",business

Clearly, the unconscious bias that women don’t belong in senior level positions plays a big role. It’s imperative that organisations change the way they make hiring and promotion decisions and ensure that eligible women are given serious consideration,”,“Those making those decisions need to pause and ask, “Are we succumbing to unconscious bias? Are we automatically giving the nod to a man when there’s an equally competent woman?” And, as our data on confidence shows, there’s a need for organisations to give more encouragement to women. Leaders can assure them of their competence and encourage them to seek promotions earlier in their careers,” the study read in part.,Another research published by Catalyst found that firms with higher levels of gender diversity, and policies and practices focused on it, are linked to lower levels of absenteeism and employee turnover; higher levels of job satisfaction, engagement, and retention; enhanced corporate reputation; and increased creativity and innovation.",business

These two main problems made her start thinking of how to create something of herself but also help create jobs for some of the youth to help curb the issue of unemployment.,“I knew this wasn’t going to be exceptional to me. This was a lesson that was exceptionally hard to learn, although it opened my mind on how I should start managing my expectations and also resolve the problems that could complicate my life in general,” she said., Because of this experience, Ishimwe resorted to making handmade clothes which she was passionate about but hadn’t gotten an opportunity to practice.,The second year student at university of Rwanda college of Education - Rukara Campus narrated that at her home, there was a neighbor who was making clothes from thread, she approached her to be trained on basics.,“Since I had passion for fashion, it wasn’t hard for me to learn the basics, and within a few months, I was good to go,” she said.,She started with making carpets then later upgraded to making wall frames, scuffs as well as decorating flowers.,She did this by adding the finishing touch to her products. To her surprise, people were impressed with her creativity and encouraged her to do more; the thing which motivated her to love what she was doing as well as work hard to ensure her customers are satisfied.,Being conversant with digital life, Ishimwe knew for a fact that what was needed for her business visibility was to create a social media account.,“I came up with a YouTube channel to showcase what I do. This, helped me reach out to a big audience for my business in time,” she added.,Ishimwe added that this has since improved her life in terms of being independent and when she joined campus, she had already mastered what is required and the preferences of customers.,What keeps her going however is the fact that she has helped transition this skill to other students, who have mastered it well and are as well doing it to help them cater for their needs.,“Apart from promoting Made in Rwanda, I am thrilled that my fellow students, especially girls, are becoming independent and also some even come up with something different from my initial idea just to create a business out of it,” she said.,Ishimwe said at times clients come up with ideas that they would love their products to be made or look like.

The initiative to establish the fund is still at proposal phase. ,For several years, overflow by river has been affecting farm and off-farm businesses surrounding the river leading to huge economic losses in the districts Rubavu, Nyabihu, Rutsiro and Ngororero Districts that rely strongly on rain-fed agriculture.,Landscape restoration is underway on 18,000 hectares that are under risk of soil erosion on Sebeya River catchment with anti-erosion activities, agro-forestry, terraces, tea plantations, rainwater harvesting tanks, climate smart agriculture practices and others and at least 70 percent has been restored.,Among the highlights of the Rwf 22 billion project, part of the money will be invested in the revolving fund to ensure sustainable conservation of restored land in the catchments and thus curb floods.,A revolving fund is a fund or account that remains available to finance an organization’s continuing operations without any fiscal year limitation, because the organization replenishes the fund by repaying money used from the account.,Celestin Hitimana, The project manager at Rwanda Rural Rehabilitation Initiative (RWARRI) said that preparation of the fund is underway.,He said it is part of the development of innovative financing mechanisms and value chains for improved livelihoods through ecological and economic benefits of the people in the catchment.,“The project will establish the community environment conservation fund as an economic-empowering mechanism for communities to access credit and build a resource base to tackle poverty while restoring the land,” he said.,He explained that a management committee of the fund will be set up considering that the fund will be accessed through ‘award as loan’ for the competitive environment projects, but also, to recognize the best performers in the landscape restoration.,“The innovative financing mechanism aims to incentivize people in the catchment to both conserve the land and get economic benefits.  We will target people especially those in groups that can initiate their own bankable conservation projects at lower interest rates,” he said.,He said they will work with financial institutions close to the beneficiaries that will help in assessing and approving bankable projects.,“It has to be done through competition. The fund must continue even after the project closes and be monitored from village to district level. There will be a business advisory team to make projects bankable. It will start with 60 villages,” he noted.,The projects include those conserving water resources, smart agriculture, and forestry, green mining, among many others.,According to Joseph Gafaranga, The Secretary General of Urugaga Imbaraga Organization, which is partnering in the project implementation, there are still many challenges related to low uptake of rainwater harvesting tanks for all households and anti-erosion practices as well as illegal mining.,Government is also constructing a Rwf7.5 billion dam to curb Sebeya River floods.,The funds were mobilized by the Government of Rwanda through the Rwandan Water Resources Board in collaboration with International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and Netherlands Development Organization (SNV).,So far 194 saving and loan groups have been established and saved Rwf38 million , 129 households got cows for livelihoods transformation,782 households got kitchen gardens to beat malnutrition as  over 11,000 residents have secured jobs amid the Covid -19 to restore the degraded landscapes.,The groups have also saved in Ejo Heza, the long term voluntary savings scheme in Rwanda, he said.,So far, over 18,000 residents have saved over Rwf120 million in the saving scheme.",business

","France, known for its exquisite baguettes and cheeses, the beautiful Eiffel, and romantic Paris, has a population of over 65 million people, adding up to 0.84 per cent of the global population. This number has been slowly but steadily rising, since the 1940’s, when the population amounted to just a little over 40 million.,Africa tells a slightly different story, With 1.2 billion people living across the continent. With a population growth rate of 2.7 per cent a year, France’s 65 million people are added to its count every two years. By 2050, Africa’s population is expected to double, reaching 2.5 billion people, which will amount to more than a quarter of the global population. By that time, two in every five children will be born in Africa, and the continent will be the youngest in the world, with over 1 billion children.,The growing population and their ever-declining age presents various challenges, with food security constituting a major issue. As more people require more food, the declining median age, that is already at 19.7, the youngest in the world, means that a smaller percentage of the population will be at a productive stage of their lives, hence fewer people will be working then mouths will need to be fed.,In terms of food security, local farming plays a key role. But although 70-80% of the local population of the working age are smallholder farmers, agriculture in the region is far from being sufficient, and the continent currently spends more than $35 billion on food imports per year.,Today, agriculture is by far the most important economic sector in the continent, providing work for over 2 thirds of the population, contributing between 30 to 60 percent of GDP, and about 30 percent of the value of exports in each country.,However, arable land and land under permanent crops occupy only about 6 percent of Africa’s total land area, and the sector is far from reaching its potential, as farmers depend on rain for irrigation, heat and moisture lead to major losses of crops, and fertilizer is a far away dream. In addition, Africa has the least mechanized agricultural system in the world, with African farmers having 10 times fewer mechanized tools per farm area than farmers in other developing regions.,With billions expected to join the working-age population in the coming decade, 45% of the world’s total surface area suitable for sustainable production, and only 2% percent of renewable water resources being used, Africa has abundant resources for a massive expansion of agricultural production.,According to McKinsey, Africa could produce two to three times more cereals and grains, which would add 20 percent more cereals and grains to the current output. Similar increases could be seen in the production of horticulture crops and livestock. Just imagine the vast effects that this amount of grains, cereals, and other crops would have on the future of food security in the continent.,The African agricultural industry is by all means facing low productivity that is hindering development in multiple areas, and is compounded by climate change, a lack of technical expertise and the vast urbanization rates. For impact on the needed scale, a massive transformation of the sector is direly needed, and while existing technologies like improved seeds and fertilizers will be critical in meeting this demand, Africa’s farmers will need new, innovative practices to increase yields and get their goods to market, both locally and internationally.,Agritech, SmartAG, and Precision Agriculture are already changing the practice around the world, and are reaching Africa, where they are needed the most. Across the continent, IoT, AI, Machine Learning, and sophisticated technologies such as temperature and moisture sensors, robots, smart sensors, and drones are being used to enhance productivity and profitability.,Solar irrigation pumps are replacing costly diesel generator pumps, drones are mapping the location, size and productivity of farms, allowing farmers to quickly spot problem areas and target them with the right amount of fertilizer or pesticides, and smart sensors use light to measure soil properties and determine when irrigation is needed.,The global Agtech market was worth $13.8bn in 2020, and is expected to reach $22bn by 2025. In Africa the sector is showing immense growth, and according to Digest Africa, 131 African-based Agritech startups have raised $62m since 2018, a rise from the mere $50,000 invested in 2015. Investments in the sector are expected to rise in 2021 due to Covid-19, and the focus of global investors in food security for the region.,To tap into the vast potential that the sector holds, local governments can help by establishing a regulatory environment, adopting national digital agriculture strategies, and endorsing high-quality, skilled-based digital education, with the young generations leading the way.,Smart Agritech is the way to reach food security across Africa, and will only be relevant when accompanied by government integration, policy changes, and global investment. There are many innovative ideas out there. Let’s make them count.",business
https://www.newtimes.co.rw/business/start-ecosystems-key-future,"Start-up ecosystems; the key to the future
","There is no doubt that start-ups are key ingredients for research, innovation and future economic growth. Start-ups around the world are not only contributing to economic development but are also being founded on the premise of solving society’s challenges and can therefore be critical for a community or country.,Start-ups do not and cannot exist in a vacuum. They are born in a specific context as parts of an entity – a network, a system – much bigger than themselves. Entrepreneurs are supported by a community of people, organisations and other start-ups that surround them. This is what we refer to as a start-up ecosystem.  Start-up ecosystems are springing up in all corners of the world and Rwanda, in my opinion, is very well-placed to establish itself as a leading start-up ecosystem on the continent and to attract key talent from other countries as was very well described in last week’s article by Nicky Gouder and Sarah Martin.,Of course, there is no recipe for exactly what should go into the pot when building a start-up ecosystem. However, there are a few key ingredients that each local ecosystem needs in order to thrive.,Start-ups themselves, of course, are an indispensable part of any start-up ecosystem. They determine the face of the local ecosystem and play an important role in economic growth, too. A high concentration of start-ups can also make an impact on the cities where they set up shop. Therefore, governments should be focused on incentivising start-ups as these can become critical economic determinants.,It would be hard to argue with the stance that schools provide one of the most important resources for start-up ecosystems around the world: talent.  Colleges, universities and other education institutions play a fundamental role in nurturing talent and setting the next generation of entrepreneurs and startup employees on their paths. In the age of accelerated technological development, environmental threats and tumultuous global politics, it is more important than ever before for institutions to be forward-thinking and equip their students for the challenges of the modern world. Startups will take on many of those challenges – and they will be launched by students studying at these institutions today. It is therefore critical for Rwanda’s educational institutions to have outreach programmes as well as collaborative initiatives with industry and start-ups.,If talent is the most important resource for start-ups, money is a close second. Few start-ups survive for long without an investor or a financial institution to back them – which is why they’re an essential pillar of every start-up ecosystem. Here, it is critical for financing mechanisms through the Rwanda Development Bank and for venture capital to thrive in the country as this will ensure that start-ups can continue to grow.,Incubators and accelerators are programmes that help start-ups succeed by providing them with mentorship, guidance, training, strategy, partnerships, R&D and funding. They’re instrumental in getting start-ups, especially early-stage ones, off the ground. Having access to an accelerator’s resources and network can make or break a start-up that hasn’t cemented itself within the ecosystem. Here, Rwanda already has a number of incubators and accelerators and this will be fundamental for the ecosystem to thrive.,Research organisations contribute to the start-up ecosystem in many different ways. For start-ups in industries like biotech and robotics, they can be their most important partners. But research organisations can also affect the start-up ecosystem itself by providing the insight needed to spot trends, address challenges and focus on strengths.,Start-up ecosystems are incredible talent magnets. As start-up hubs mature, they bring the best and the brightest business minds, developers, designers, investors…the list goes on. Cities benefit enormously from this influx: highly-skilled workers soon change projects, cross-pollinate organisations, and start-up up their own companies. It becomes a virtuous circle – innovation and the economy booms. It is for this reason that my colleagues highlighted the role of start-up VISAs in their article last week.,Start-ups are usually the pioneers of innovation and therefore regulation needs to provide the required support and ability for this to happen. It is therefore critical for governments to provide sound and robust regulatory frameworks that do not stifle innovation or make it hard for start-ups to operate. Regulatory sandboxes can be a key element in this regard and Rwanda already has experience in this element.,Start-ups are critical for any country and its future growth trajectory. This is even more so in a post-pandemic world and also a country tries to solve some of its key challenges. Start-ups do not happen automatically but need an ecosystem which supports their growth and allows them to thrive and flourish. Rwanda is already on the path to create an enabling environment and additional initiatives can truly transform it in a global start-up ecosystem",business

High-tech industries saw an increase of 11 per cent in 2020, and cross-border M&A s rose by 54 per cent, mostly in ICT and pharmaceutical industries,” the report says.,The government of India also recorded positive growth (13%), particularly boosted by investments in the digital sector.,The report says that data on an announcement basis – on M&As, greenfield investments and project finance – provides a mixed picture on forward trends and confirms the weak outlook for 2021.,“Greenfield project announcements in 2020, 35 per cent lower than in 2019, do not bode well for new investment in industrial sectors in 2021,” the report says.,The decline in announced international project finance deals, important for investment in infrastructure, was more contained at -2 per cent, but the uptick in the last part of the year was largely concentrated in developed countries.,“These investment types are crucial for productive capacity and infrastructure development and thus for sustainable recovery prospects,” Zhan added.,The report warns that “the far more limited capacity of developing countries to roll out economic support packages to stimulate investment in infrastructure will result in an asymmetric recovery of project-finance-driven FDI.”,UNCTAD expects any increases in global FDI flows in 2021 to come not from new investment in productive assets but from cross-border M&As, especially in technology and healthcare – two industries affected differently by the pandemic.,“Although their investment activity slowed down initially in 2020, they are now set to take advantage of low interest rates and increasing market values to acquire assets in overseas markets for expansion, as well as rivals and smaller innovative companies affected by the crisis.”,European companies are set to attract more than 60 per cent of the technology deals in value terms, but several developing economies are also seeing an increase.,Consequently, South African investors plan to acquire stakes in healthcare providers across Africa and Asia. And Indian IT companies have announced a 30 per cent increase in acquisitions, targeting European and other markets for information technology services.",business

","As Rwanda continues to position itself as a leading financial services centre, being able to attract the right companies and more importantly, talent and knowledge, to the country is a key ingredient for the success of this industry. The recent introduction of new fiscal and corporate legislation will continue to attract foreign direct investment to the country. ,The business friendly eco-system, and the ‘open for business’ attitude of the country will also attract individuals to relocate to Rwanda, and also result in a transfer of knowledge with the local population, which will then lead to a long term and self-sustained success. Attracting start ups and their founders to Rwanda will also lead to employment opportunities, in different industries.,Rwanda can position itself as a start-up hub in Africa, and encourage growth of early-stage businesses by attracting talent from around the world. This could give the country a first mover advantage in Africa, in this space.,There are various measures governments can introduce to foster the right environment for entrepreneurship. ,It is important to understand that entrepreneurs are highly mobile, quickly moving to jurisdictions they believe offer the best mix of investment-friendly, attractive fiscal regimes and supportive legal environments. In view of this, countries need to not only compete to ensure they keep attracting foreign talent, but to also ensure they are fostering the right ecosystem for these start-ups to thrive.,A start-up is typically defined as a young company which is founded by one or more entrepreneurs to develop a unique product or service to bring to the market. Over the past decade, the global appetite for start ups has grown exponentially. Technological innovation has  brought about profound changes to organisations and entire industries. ,The so-called Fourth Industrial Revolution has ushered in various opportunities in a number of fields such as artificial intelligence, internet of things and smart manufacturing. Also important is the rise of medtech and fintech which many a times start out from academic research. The rise of technology companies, creative products and novel service offerings have made governments and individuals appreciate the role of entrepreneurial innovators.,While countries have long-standing migration channels for business purposes, they are often not best suited for individuals looking at establishing a start up business. Entrepreneurial or investor visas are often unattainable for start-up founders having early-stage, high-risk, innovative business projects, due to their stringent requirements and their emphasis on immediate economic returns, such as job creation, which can discourage risk taking.,The introduction of start up visas has grown rapidly in recent years. Countries commonly associated with a tradition of settlement such as Canada, Australia and New Zealand have all introduced start up visas. A number of European countries and emerging economies in Asia and South America have also launched start up visas.  ,The demand for such visas has led to a wide-range of countries to offer such initiatives and following Covid, with the rise of remote working and the already established digital nomads, the list is expected to continue growing. ,Each country has its own set of criteria and requirements for the attainment of a start up visa, which means that individuals need to carefully evaluate their personal situation to choose the country which best fits their business and personal needs. Some countries who have been offering start up visas for a substantial amount of years are now looking at enhancing their programmes and making them more competitive by introducing measures which may lead an individual in possession of such a visa to apply for permanent residence. ",business

","The Covid-19 pandemic has evolved from a major public health crisis to also a major economic and jobs crisis, the full extent of which is still unfolding. Yet, at its core, Covid-19 is just the latest in a growing list of disruptors confronting governments. They are also testimony to a global environment is becoming increasingly volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous.,Tech disruptions, cyberthreats, terrorism, natural hazards – there is no doubt that disrupters abound. Massive societal change and demographic shifts, likewise, demand adaptation and preparation by governments.,While future events may not take the same shape as the pandemic, they WILL require governments to navigate profound disruptions nimbly and effectively. This short note will seek to present an overarching framework based on lessons on how our governments can navigate a continuously disrupted world.,The pandemic threatens our health, livelihood and peace of mind – our way of life. In times like this, all of the population all need public service organisations to help them stay resilient and emerge stronger.,Public services are at the forefront of the crisis. While public emergency response and recovery capabilities are strong, they are best suited for discrete events with a fixed duration. We face a very different challenge today. Public services must rapidly adjust to this new reality across three overlapping dimensions: crisis response, pandemic operations and long-term recovery. This is a balancing act in managing the now and the next, the present state and the future reality, or the new normal.,As from the very case of transmission and response from a public health authority, it was obvious that government had to deal with a number of issues concurrently and ensure that it can handle a crisis of unknown proportions and on multiple fronts. The key dimensions that one can highlight are:,• Surge response - people’s engagement with public service organisations is surging. They want to know what will happen to the vital services they interact with;,• Response governance - collaboration across an ecosystem of government agencies is at the heart of successfully keeping everyone involved in the Covid response pulling in the same direction;,• Communication & collaboration – providing trusted information about the pandemic is a lifeline for the people;,•  Economic stability - the pandemic is having a very strong effect on the global economy and governments had to intervene forcefully;,• Operational continuity - operations had to flex as numerous agencies had to deal with new requests and also accommodate the safety measures introduced which impinged on operations;,• Monitoring & response - amid all the noise and uncertainty that surrounds the pandemic, the facts will see us through,This pandemic will end. When it does, we will reflect on what we have been through – what we have lost and what we have learned. What’s heartening is that people are resilient, innovative and strong. So are public sector organisations.,I am confident that going forward, many of the capabilities we all built in in our public service organisations will be embraced as standard practice. In fact, I am confident that this experience and response to the crisis will place government agencies in a position to make rapid advancements in performance, leaving legacy technology and operations behind in favour of new capabilities adopted during the pandemic.,There are five main lessons that can be distilled, and which can be described as the five forces of change in public sector organisations:,• Flexible workforce - to keep the workforce safe, public organisations transitioned employees to remote working status during the crisis. With all the logistics and security issues addressed, there is no reason for this to disappear when the crisis ends;,• Break the silos - building on the networks formed during the crisis, public sectors need to continue working more closely across ministries and agencies;,• Embrace digital - the crisis has shown that public services need to be digital to the core to build additional resilience. More work needs to be done to deepen digitalization and to ensure that the mentality is truly digital and seamless. This will bring benefits to all;,• Secure supply chains - supply chains had to be assessed and strengthened. In the future, public sector organisations will continue to adopt new sourcing and data models so that supply chains are flexible and secure;,• The role of AI - AI-powered technology is helping agencies process information quickly and accurately right now. Automation and AI will become more desirable for maintaining service levels. The future will see greater adoption of AI across public organisations. With it will come new roles, new governance and new public service delivery models.,The future environment remains highly volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous. Different shocks will ask from our organisations a response, not necessarily as that necessitated by the pandemic, but we will still have to rise up to the challenge.,Governments will need enhanced capabilities in three areas to help navigate both current uncertainties and tomorrow’s even more uncertain world,Identifying forces and events that could place unprecedented demands on governments and their mission but could also create new opportunities for governments. Foresight abilities generally focus on two themes – understanding trends and uncertainties and analysing scenarios. The key is to use foresight as a mechanism to build organizational bias toward action rather than paralysis in the face of uncertainty.,Adjusting quickly to changes affecting customers, operations and the broader ecosystem. Agility requires organizational characteristics that allow resources, data and staffing to flow and adapt as needed. This means, becoming an adaptable organization, driven by fast, flexible decision-making that learns and adapts constantly.,Withstanding and recovering from disruptions. Investing in resilience can help organisations structure their processes, resources and systems to better withstand future disruptions, so that performance will remain relatively unaffected or “bounce back” quickly.,The Covid pandemic will be a turning point for us all, and for everyone we serve as leaders of the public service. This is a challenge to which we have all rose and confronted. This is a time to build and adapt our organisations so they can weather the most unexpected events and disruptors because public service will always remain at the forefront of any crisis.,What is required is a cultural shift, one that recognises that success requires the ability to anticipate, adapt to, and withstand disruptive events. Leaders should embrace these capabilities for the organization while developing their own skills in foresight, agility and resilience.",business

The resulting textile is known as felt or boiled wool.,The reason behind the intervention Dufitumukiza explained, is to ensure women are kept employed. Also, there is a need for the organization to conserve and value this kind of art done by hands (natural).,“Identifying and fostering creativity is crucial for continued economic growth and social change not only in Rwanda but Africa in general. Apart from the business perspective and creating jobs, the mental aspect also comes in,” he added.,They recruit vulnerable women from the community, they range from widows, young mothers, HIV positive patients to those from poor backgrounds.,With their members’ vulnerability exposing them to trauma, the organization offers trauma counseling to the beneficiaries by providing psycho education and individual counseling.,If it wasn’t for Handspun Hope Organization, the women attested that they wouldn’t have become the open minded people they are today.,For instance, the organization has helped them embrace the changes that come their way.

","With a month and a half under its belt, 2021 has already brought along some monumental events. The USA inaugurated its first woman vice president, Elon Musk became the richest man in the world, Facebook and Twitter banned Donald Trump, and Covid vaccines began rolling out. But the most surprising, and some would even argue, most significant event of 2021 to date, is the stepping down of Jeff Bezos as Amazon CEO. Earlier this month, Bezos announced he will be leaving his post later this year, and will be replaced by Andy Jassy, currently the CEO of Amazon’s cloud Web Services. Bezos will still be present in the company, transitioning to executive chairman of the board.,This marks the end of an era. Bezos launched Amazon from his garage back in 1994, naming it “Amazon” because it was “exotic and different”. The online store began by selling books, and within two months sales were up to $20,000 a week. The company’s soaring success led to its IPO that took place in 1997, at $18 per share. Today the share price is $3277.,Bezos was a trailblazer of new ideas and concepts, single handedly leading his garage-born company to becoming a global success story in only a couple of years. On the path to success, he also established the fundamentals for online retail, with innovative thinking leading every step of the way.,Since the launch of Amazon, innovation and creativity became leading pillars in the business and tech world, and today they are not only important for company growth, but for actual survival. In our ever-changing world, where companies rise and fall on a daily basis, managers can learn a lot from the mighty giant that is Amazon, and its thought-leading, soon-to-be former CEO.,Bezos began his career on Wall Street, and quit to start Amazon, in the very (very) early days of e-commerce. After the fast profits of his online bookstore,  he began his customer-centric thinking, and sent out an email to a 1000 random customers asking ‘‘Besides the things we sell today, what would you like to see us sell?’”. The answers he received were all pretty lengthy, but they all had one thing in common: they all wanted Amazon to sell whatever it was they were looking for at that exact moment, with one customer asking for windshield wiper blades, and another for plastic cups for a party (sustainability was not as essential).,“I thought to myself, ‘We can sell anything this way,’” Bezos said at an Economic Club of Washington talk back in 2018. And thus, began the crazy journey of Amazon, with Bezos maintaining an innovative, thought provoking approach, as the company continued growing. Amazon is responsible for some of the most --- practices in retail today, with the customer-centric approach leading the way. From powerful recommendation algorithms that tell us what to purchase, through customer ratings that reveal preferred products, to the fact that anyone can open a virtual storefront from their own garage, anywhere in the world.,Alongside its innovative practices, the company is also a pioneer in fostering a culture of innovation for its millions (!!) of employees, with ways and practices that could lead other business owners in inserting innovation to their ventures.,According to the company’s employees, or “Amazonians”, innovation takes place as a part of everyday work. As the company’s customer-centric approach leads every step of operations, there are a few key ways that employees use;,A passion for invention is a key factor in everyday proceedings, and employees are encouraged to think outside of the box in order to come up with new ways to provide the best services for their customers. This is encouraged through the PR/FAQ document (Press Release / Frequently Asked Questions); The employee outlines their vision for a new product through a theoretical press release, and writes a FAQ that explains the customer benefits and answers potential customer questions. Then, a fellow team evaluates the idea, leading some to, initial funding, development, market deployment. Amazon Go, Prime, and Alexa were launched through PR/FAQs.,The company’s long-term vision and focus is another important factor, and to that end, Amazon has never paid its shareholders a dividend, but instead invests all the profits into existing products and bold new bets. This reality encourages employees to always stay on their feet in terms of new products, and also fosters failure as an option, and even a somewhat positive outcome of their boldness. As long as it’s ok to fail, people are not afraid to suggest the craziest, most out-of-the-box inventions.,Another important factor is the “two-pizza rule” stating that every internal team should be small enough that it can be fed with two pizzas. The goal wasn’t to cut back on catering expenses, but to encourage a sense of responsibility and entrepreneurship, while saving time on managing timetables.,These practices are some of the reasons why Amazon went from $511,000 in revenues in 1995, to $386.064bn, a 37.62% increase from 2019. “Today, we employ 1.3 million talented, dedicated people, serve hundreds of millions of customers and businesses, and are widely recognized as one of the most successful companies in the world”, Bezos wrote in his goodbye letter to employees earlier this month. “How did that happen? Invention. Invention is the root of our success. We’ve done crazy things together, and then made them normal…Keep inventing, and don’t despair when at first the idea looks crazy. Remember to wander. Let curiosity be your compass. It remains Day 1”.,In 1995, Amazon had one million products for sale, and they were all books. Now there are more than 350 million products, — and over 2000 of those products are windshield wiper blades. If that’s no innovation at its finest, I don’t know what is.",business

from waste
","Noel Nizeyimana is the Chief Executive of Greencare Rwanda ltd, a company he co-founded with three other young entrepreneurs (Francis Mizinduko, Christian Ruzindana, and Jean Paul Iyakaremye), after graduating at University of Rwanda in 2015. ,The entrepreneurs use waste especially plastics and sachets that they heat and mix with sand to make bricks and pavers.,This has enabled them to offer employment opportunities to a number of Rwandans, yet keeping the environment clean.,Although they had different expertise in soil and environment management, civil engineering and crops science, they were committed to reshape the waste management in Rwanda by converting existing systems of solid waste management “landfilling” into industrial recycling plants. ,The company was officially registered in 2016 and licensed in 2017 by Rwanda Development Board (RDB) and Rwanda Utility and Regulations Authority (RURA) respectively. ,While dealing with urban agriculture, and solid waste management issues as part of their undergraduate program in Soil and Environment Management and Civil Engineering, the four business partners saw that the waste management situation in Huye city, where their campus was located, was not well managed. ,According to Nizeyimana, the waste collection services were poorly organized; the small quantity of waste collected was disposed of in unhygienic ways.,For instance, the waste was piled up mostly in the streets and in unmanaged landfill sites, creating several serious health and social threats, including diseases, insufferable odour, leakage of pollutants into water sources, methane gas, and exposing the waste-collectors to toxic and hazardous substances, he said. ,In collaboration with Huye District, the entrepreneurs worked together to discover a sustainable solution for solid waste management by organizing waste collectors and transforming all waste generated at Huye recycling plants. ,“75 per cent of waste received at the facility is biodegradable waste, which has been converted into packaged organic compost branded ‘Grekompost’ by using a windrow composting system and 20 per cent is plastics and sachets,” Nizeyimana stated.,The co-founders transform ecological pavers and bricks by mixing appropriate ratio of plastics to sand under a desired temperature. ,Today they have a production capacity of 400 tons of compost per year and 2,560 meters squared of ecological pavers per year. They have employed 25 permanent young men and women working in compost and ecological pavers production.,The entrepreneurs also work with five agro dealers companies that distribute GreKompost to the farmers across the country.,Just like any business, challenges are inevitable. Among their day to day challenges include insufficient skills and knowledge on the best technology for solid waste management. ,“Lack of stakeholder’s inclusivity for solid waste management implementation, lack of a proprietary model or policy for funding and financing solid waste management projects is still a problem,” Nizeyimana emphasised.,The young businessmen also claim that there is a shortage of policies regarding integrated solid waste management, for example, currently solid waste management system used is waste collection, transportation and landfilling.,This system, they say, leads to waste resources by dumping the waste; the waste produces toxic gases, and contaminated underground water by heavy metals. Landfilling areas reduce the land available for agriculture and are a breeding ground for bacteria which can cause many diseases to the communities surrounding the facility for example, Nduba landfill in Kigali. ,The entrepreneurs also lack clear policy regarding manufactured organic fertilizers use due to the low number of industries engaged in compost production at industrial scale, thus leading to the lack of market, subsidies and distribution channel.,They highlighted that manufactured organic fertilizers need to be regularized as well as chemical fertilizers in order to promote organic fertilizers and Made in Rwanda.,The businessmen are calling upon the government to adopt integrated solid waste management in different districts, for instance, waste generation, collection, and waste treatment through Reduce, Reuse, Recycle system.  ,They are also urging the government to develop policies and regulations regarding integrated solid waste management from waste generation to waste treatment. ",business

Some recovery was noted in the second half of the year with the completion of several deals,” Ashley Schoombee is quoted saying in the report.,Consequently, the slowdown effect on the pandemic was evident in the volumes and values of non-local corporate, sovereign and supranational debt raised during the year.,Like it has been in the past four years, the initial public offering (IPO) activity continued a downward trend.,According to the report, a total of five IPOs were recorded in 2020, the lowest number in a decade.,In 2019, the volume of IPO activity recorded a decline of 47 per cent compared to 2018.,PwC points out that the largest IPO in 2020 by value was the dual listing of Bytes Technology Group on the LSE and JSE, raising $467-million.,Bytes is a UK business that demerged from South African technology company Altron.,In contrast however, further offer (FO) value in 2020 increased by 16% compared to 2019, but fewer companies accessed the market in 2020, which continues the trend of lower FO volumes over the past few years, PwC states.,The report highlighted that domestic deals accounted for 71 per cent of ECM volume and value recorded in 2020.,This has been the same trend for the past couple of years.,Statistically, domestic activity accounted for 72% and 78% of ECM volume and value, respectively. There was a significant decline in outbound ECM activity between 2019 and 2020.,In addition, PwC reports that African issuers have raised $167-billion in non-local currency debt from 536 issuances over the past five years.,“Patterns of corporate non-local currency bond issuances have been somewhat inconsistent over the past five years, owing to the small number of active issuers and the variable size of issuances over the period. Total proceeds in 2020 represented a five-year high of $7.2-billion.” The report reads in part.,“A state of uncertainty seems to have become the ‘new normal’ globally, and we can expect some degree of volatility and caution to continue to affect Africa’s capital markets activity in 2021,” Andrew Del Boccio, PwC Africa Capital Markets Leader, said in a previous interview with the press.,Egypt has consistently been the largest issuer of sovereign bonds over the past five years, accounting for 38% of all sovereign bonds issued in 2020.,In 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic hit the country, many countries cancelled or postponed their plans to issue bonds in light of the pandemic related economic and financial uncertainties.",business

More homes will be designed with flexible layouts to suit different generations, which can be adapted as families’ needs change.,Homes of the future in Kigali will increasingly tap into neighborhood energy systems, feature flexible layouts and use improved technology to make automatic decisions about heating, security and even postal deliveries,,More innovation will be used when designing “third age” homes for people over 65, reflecting demand for accommodation with lifts, level access and communal activities, whilst retaining privacy and a sense of ownership.,By 2050, technology will transform homes into collectors and storers of energy, with electricity, now generated by non-fossil fuel, most likely to be used to heat homes and hot water.  ,Electric cars will be commonplace with every property equipped with a charging point. The future home will manage its energy use from a centralized platform, combining heating, electrical consumption, ventilation and vehicle charging.,As energy efficiency becomes ever more important, ideas currently used in workplaces will become standard in homes, such as allowing non-essential equipment to automatically power down when electricity is at peak price.,Urban planning that combines adequate housing with quality, inclusive and sustainable neighborhoods.

The options could vest over a number of years, depending on the time the employee has been employed with the company.,The granting of the option is, typically, not a taxable transaction, however once the employee exercises the option, this could be deemed to be a fringe benefit and taxable accordingly.,Phantom Share Plans are being more commonly used nowadays to provide benefits to,employees, without the possible complications of having them as shareholders.,Phantom share plans are plans where the employee does not receive actual shares and does not become a shareholder of the company, but he/ she is entitled to the dividend as an actual shareholder.

Each of us tried to take some of their savings obtained from different casual works they do when they are not at school and invested in the initiative. We hope that the initiative is a preparation of green jobs in the future for both students and vulnerable communities,” he said.,He said that the tree nursery plantation on land availed by the school has started to create green jobs for women and youth around the campus.,“There are two permanent employees who help us look after the tree nursery and when there is a lot of work, at least ten people get casual work where each gets a wage of Rwf2, 000 per day,” he said.,The nursery includes orange, mango and citron fruit trees.,“Some will be given to vulnerable families for free while members of the public can also buy these fruits trees. If someone needs over 1,000 seedlings, we can sell them at Rwf1, 000 per seedling but for those who need fewer seedlings, they can buy one seedling at Rwf2, 000,” he noted.,He said that once planted the trees, vulnerable families could generate income from them.,“After one and half years, one mango tree can provide income of over Rw50, 000 per month during two harvesting seasons. These could help eliminate malnutrition but also help generate income. They can plant trees in gardens which will also green the city,” he said.,He said the trees will green the school and some communities in the city.,The plastics used in raising the seedlings, he said, are also recycled in Agroplast Ltd, the company which recycles plastic waste into different materials in Kigali city.,Faida Zoubeda Uwase, a deputy co-founding member said that seven members of the body are female showing the passion of girls in environment conservation and job creation while still at school.,“If families manage to plant fruits in their home gardens that will reduce cost on expensive fruits they buy on the market.  We will also set up environment clubs to help educate people,” she said.,It is also a platform to help us to put into practice what we study at university.

","As Mobile Money increasingly becomes popular locally and across the world, fraud cases have been on the rise.,As of 2019 there were 481 million registered mobile money accounts in Africa, making up 46 per cent of global accounts, with more people turning to using mobile wallets instead of cash, as a safer option.,The number of international and African players entering and expand into new markets across the continent providing user-friendly alternative to processing micro-payments and reduce the amount of cash people need to carry with them.,However, with the progress, cyber security experts say have also seen an increase of multiple forms of fraud.,Bethwel Opil, a Manager at Kaspersky in Africa said that threat actors are constantly coming up with more innovative tactics to compromise people’s wallets whether these pertain to traditional bank accounts or mobile wallets,“While there is ample benefit to be gained from mobile money, spam, phishing, social engineering, and fraud all form part of the cyber-attack landscape when it comes to this innovation. Threat actors are constantly coming up with more innovative tactics to compromise people’s wallets whether these pertain to traditional bank accounts or mobile wallets,” Opil said.,The firm noted that telcos and other service providers have to maintain standards and procedures that will curb vulnerability as well as improve consumer education.,“Security is only as strong as the weakest link in the chain. And like all other digital solutions, this is often the end user. Education is therefore the most critical component of mitigating the risk of social engineering compromises from people opening malicious links, sharing sensitive information, or falling foul of fraudulent schemes,” Opil said.,Among ways clients can reduce vulnerability include avoiding having a device being compromised by refraining from clicking on malicious emails, attachments, or other messages., “Users must look out for red flags in communication from those purporting to be from service providers. For example, they need to be wary of grammatical mistakes, attempts to incite a sense of urgency or danger, e-mail addresses and links that differ from the official ones (even if just by one letter), and so on,” Kaspersky officials advice.,“Never trust messages unconditionally. It is imperative to check any potential issues through one’s personal account on the Website or in the mobile money app. This is especially important when it comes to messages confirming the crediting of funds,” they added.,Users are also urged to avoid using unfamiliar delivery service especially with regard to online purchases.,“It goes without saying that users must never give out personal information beyond what is necessary for the transaction. This includes usernames and passwords,” experts further said.,“In many respects, it is still the ‘Wild West’ when it comes to mobile money and e-wallets. Even though the solutions are safely used by millions of people daily, hackers are always on the lookout for soft targets.

Rwanda
","Mukande, a 31-year-old woman from a remote village in Gisagara District is sweeping the ground outside her home while talking to one of Ignite’s on-field agents. Her husband is out in the field, working on their maize crops.,Her 11-year-old son is standing close by, next to one of the family’s cows, while her younger daughters are running around the yard. “Having light in our home completely changed our lives”, she exclaims. “The kids can now do their homework after dark, and I can cook whenever I want to”.,Mukande and her family have had access to solar-based electricity in their home for the past year. “Now with the lights, we sleep much better. We used to sleep with the cows before, because it wasn’t safe to leave them outside due to the many thefts going on after dark. Now, thanks to the light we keep them outside, and everybody has more room to sleep comfortably,”Mukande points out “,Mukande’s story is a depiction of millions across Africa, who have been connected to electricity in recent years through off-grid solar solutions., During the final months of 2020, Ignite’s employees canvased various villages across Rwanda’s rural communities, gathering some meaningful testimonials about life before, and after gaining access to power. And the changes are undoubtedly monumental.,Across the continent, the number of people gaining access to electricity doubled from 9 million a year between 2000 and 2013 to 20 million people between 2014 and 2019, with Kenya, Senegal, Ghana, Ethiopia, and Rwanda playing the main role in the revolution. In Rwanda, the access rate rose from 9.7 per cent in 2010 over 34 per cent in 2020, to almost 85 per cent in 2019. As numbers of connections per year grew, so did the role of solar off-grid systems, reaching more than 25% by 2019.,But alongside vast improvements and development, Africa’s population growth rate is outpacing the rate of electricity connections, and Covid-19 is already affecting electrification efforts, as global and local budgets are directed to fighting the pandemic. While billions of dollars go to vaccination efforts, and other pandemic-related, necessary affairs, it is important to remember that unlike other countries that can put all their efforts into the Covid fight, Africa has other crucial needs that must be addressed. Electricity access is a leading necessity, vastly influential on multiple elements of everyday lives, and leading to ample development across the continent.,“Before having light we used petrol and risked burning the house”, says Celestine, 45, who lives with her husband and their 2 children in a village in the Gisagara district. “Now we feel much safer.”,Throughout the rural areas of Sub Saharan Africa, petrol and other combustible fuels are used for lighting, cooking, and heating purposes, which are often done through indoor open fires. The fire and smoke contribute to high mortality and disease rates, as homes can be easily burnt to the ground, and smoke causes various diseases including pneumonia, lung cancer. Across the region about 1 million mortalities a year are caused by smoke-related health issues.,The problem is not only in the household. About 730 million tons of biomass are burned for fuel each year in developing countries, releasing as much as 1 billion tons CO2 into the atmosphere. In addition open fires emit high concentrations of a number of black carbon and methane, both with significant climate consequences.,Having home electricity also provides various opportunities for increasing household income. “Before having lights, we used to bring maize to clean, and had to finish before nightfall, and now we can continue after dark.” Mukande explains.,“Before having the solar system we used to sell 30 kg of maize, now we are selling 60”.,Across the SSA, over 52% of the working population is in the agriculture field. But albeit a source of employment for over half of the continent’s population, the sector contributes only 23% of the GDP, due to poor irrigation, rotting crops, and insufficient national funding. This contributes to food insecurity which is a major concern for the continent, even more so now during the Covid period. To that end, upping crop sales by 50% is that more meaningful.,Education has been a sore spot for people all over the world since Covid began. In the western hemisphere, millions of children have been studying from home, via different online platforms. But across remote communities in the SSA region, such platforms are not really an option. School closures in the region sent around 250 million children home, and learning completely stopped for most of them, with many likely to never return to class. Having home electricity is meaningful for the long term, as it may enable access to online schooling. But even the light alone makes a meaningful difference. “Before we had light, the children didn’t have time to do their homework. They were at school until 5:30pm and then did house chores,” says Nyirarukundo, 43 from Kivomo.,“Now kids are studying and getting good grades at school”. And it is not just the kids that put in more effort into their education. “My 27 year old son is studying! And showing interest! His sister, 15 years old, is also doing much better in school. Their knowledge increased”, Mukamparaye, 57, from Kivomo exclaimed excitedly.,Despite the immense progress throughout the past decade, more than 600 million people across Africa are still living without electricity access, and these numbers are expected to increase due to population growth and the Covid pandemic. For us who take electricity and its various effects for granted, it is crucial to take a look at some of these testimonials, portraying the change that electricity has, on the smallest, and largest scales. As we redefine global priorities during these turbulent times, it is important to remember that basic infrastructure such as running water and electricity play an essential role in human development, and should not be left behind.",business

https://www.newtimes.co.rw/business/mission-oriented-post-covid-transformation,"Mission-oriented post-Covid transformation
","Although Rwanda was growing at a fast pace and transforming itself into a beacon of excellence for the continent, the pandemic will definitely leave a set of scars behind. The crisis we are experiencing has a triple face: a grave economic situation, accompanied by an increasingly urgent climate catastrophe, and exacerbated by a health emergency.,Our recovery must therefore have the direction of inclusive smart growth: more innovation, more well-being and more sustainability. This is essential to rethinking the direction of growth and also the way in which public and private interact, in order to ensure a long-term sustainable path. The objectives of sustainability and inclusion must cut across this entire transformation and must emerge from a process of consultation and discussion with institutional actors, but above all with citizens and social movements. This “bottom-up” approach allows challenges to be defined in such a way that they speak to the lives of citizens.,This transformative process requires a new approach to policy-making which is referred to as a mission-oriented approach. Missions are tools for transformations aimed at solving crucial social, environmental and technological challenges, by means of a concrete process, characterised by achievable targets, and involving as many sectors as possible; public institutions, social organisations and above all citizens, thus putting the person and the community at the centre of the economy.,This philosophy means that we should start looking beyond GDP as the yardstick for development and the United Nations’ 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are aimed to provide such a direction and to also highlight the economic, social and environmental challenges on a global scale.,Tackling and solving these challenges requires a fundamental change from traditional industrial policies. It is crucial to move from a logic centred on a list of sectors to be supported, towards a better and more complete identification of problems whose solutions require multiple sectors and actors to finance and develop processes of innovation and transformation.,The idea behind missions is not to start by asking which sectors or technologies should be helped, but rather which problems need to be solved. The key is to think about problems in the most ambitious way possible, involving various economic actors in the solution (public, private and non-profit) and establishing new forms of collaboration at the level of individual projects. Much of the discussion around missions can be conceptualised in terms of major challenges, which in the case of the United Nations are represented by the 17 SDGs. Transforming these challenges into concrete missions is the first step.,Missions should be cross-cutting in terms of sectors and actors involved in the process. In this sense, a “vertical” mission on a theme can have a cross-cutting impact on different economic and social areas. The dynamics are both top-down, in terms of directionality of the challenge and the identification of the mission, and bottom-up, with the activation of projects that involve multiple actors and solve the everyday problems of citizens.,The success of missions requires the fulfilment of a series of conditions, which must be embedded in the process before and during their execution.,First, they need to be bold, inspirational and with social relevance. The missions must be able to inspire the actors involved and have a broad relevance for society. They must be able to connect with the challenges of sustainable development to have an impact on a significant part of the population.,Secondly, missions require citizen involvement. For their definition, implementation and evaluation, missions require citizen participation in public debate. They must also be shared by a healthy number of institutional and social actors, so that they can also be pursued through different political cycles.,Third, they need to be targeted, measurable and time-bound. The missions must have a precise direction. They must be focused, measurable (with tools that capture the overall qualitative impact) and bound by a time limit.,Fourth, missions need to be backed by public sector capacity. Missions require the development of skills and entrepreneurial spirit by the state. Public actors must conceive of themselves as elements of a system that creates and shapes markets and technologies. Among the capacities that the state must assume there are: the search for coordination between different structures that operate by departmental silos; greater flexibility and autonomy of some departments, agencies or other public organisations; a positive approach to risk, linked to learning processes; the possibility of setting a strategic use of public procurement on the entire industrial and social apparatus.,Fifth, ambitious but realistic. The missions must be ambitious in order to motivate the actors involved, but sufficiently realistic to be achieved. The financing of projects, by public and private parties, must be adequate and follow the needs for the realisation of the mission, without constraining its definition with strictly fixed limits or a short-term return perspective.,Finally, cross-cutting and bottom-up. The potential of the missions is maximised by the activation of multiple initiatives between different sectors, actors and disciplines. Several projects contribute to the realisation of missions, as well as to their possible redefinition, through constraints and opportunities that may bubble up during their implementation.,The mission approach presented here provides a lens through which to rethink economic and industrial policy. It is an innovative way to collaborate across sectors inspired by the great challenges we face. It must involve different actors, from the institutional arena to the business world, from universities to the third sector.",business

It was initially scheduled to take place from February 21-28 but was postponed to contain the spread of Covid-19.,Mugisha has not been on good terms with his club since winning the Grand Prix Chantal Biya in November last year after he was denied a move out of the club to end long-standing feuds with his coach Adrien Niyonshuti.,While SACA refused to release Mugisha and instead left him out of the squad training for the Tour du Rwanda as disputes remain unsolved, the rider told , that he no longer sees himself playing under a coach who, he says, has been treating him badly adding that he prefers to miss out on this year’s Tour du Rwanda until his contract expires in September.,“How can I play under a coach who beats me? I can’t work with someone with whom I have disputes. I requested the club to let me go but I was threatened that I have nowhere else to go,” claims Mugisha.,“I can’t continue doing my job in such conditions. Of course, I am unlikely to increase my points if I don’t participate in this year’s Tour du Rwanda edition but there are still chances in future editions,” he added.,Mugisha’s relationship with his coach Niyonshuti has been strained since July last year when the duo was involved in a training bust-up.,Although he is regarded as one of the favorites to win this year’s Tour du Rwanda, the rider was left out of the team preparing for Tour du Rwanda 2021 and is not able to train on his own after he was requested by SACA to return cycling equipment.,Niyonshuti recently told the media that, despite recent impressive performance at Grand Prix Chantal Biya, the young rider’s lack of discipline could ruin his cycling career if he does not make the profession a priority.,The tactician said he would be happy to see Mugisha back in the group and focus together on winning the Tour du Rwanda.,“Mugisha is a good player but he needs someone to advise him to help him give his career a good direction.

","With the Covid-19 pandemic and measures to curb it, many across the city are spending more time at home. This has led some to seek ways to improve their homes to make them more appealing.,Two young female graduates, Allen Ingabire and Paulette Mpano, driven by their passion for nature have found a business opportunity therein in interior and home décor.,It all started with their love for plants; how they transform spaces and their versatile capacity to act as herbs and medicine.,This, they say was fascinating to them and through research, they came to understand that this could be developed into a business. They ultimately saw potential in this field after discerning that it was a few people who had ventured into this type of business.,The more they talked to people about this idea, the more they were pushed and motivated to go for it. That’s how Ivy Bliss Murugo was born.,Their idea was to invest in something that would allow people to explore the beauty of nature in their homes and offices. They also desired to contribute towards the fight against climate change.,For three years now, the young entrepreneurs have had their focus on landscaping, indoor and outdoor decorations, where they sell potted plants, do gardening, designing and advisory in this field.,Their products are made through a combination of different materials from different vendors to come up with finished designs.,“To elaborate on this, we work with potters who make the pots, nursery owners to get plants and what we do is come up with an Ivy Bliss potted plant, or buy plants somewhere and plant them in someone’s garden,” they say.,When it was all still an idea, Ingabire, (the founder) had a conversation with the CEO and co-founder of Akilah institute, Elizabeth Dearborn Hughes, about what she was going to do in the future since she had just graduated (from Akilah), as she recalls.,“I explained to her the idea of starting a plant business in Kigali. Two months after the conversation, Elizabeth challenged me to provide 70 potted plants to all Akilah staff.  It was a huge first order and we were not prepared. We did not see it coming but we accepted the challenge. We had pots made, searched for plants and everything else that goes into a well finished product and delivered as agreed.”,And though, there are so many things they did not understand about plants, running a business and working with different vendors, their project ended up being a success, they say, adding that the money they made from this project became their capital and that it has been a fun journey since then.,They have since learnt a lot from the job. For example, they now understand that to be a great designer, one needs passion coupled with constant learning.,“This industry evolves a lot and it requires someone to really be on the lookout for what’s trending. We don’t call ourselves great designers or landscapers but we hope that one day we will be. What we most love about our job is the satisfaction that comes with doing what we love and seeing the expected results come to reality,” the girls share.,Even though they say they don’t have full time employees, they delight in the ability to create occasional opportunities for talented potters, plant nursery owners, carpenters, and gardeners. That makes them feel like they are contributing to their community.,“We also love that our business gives opportunities to our clients to explore what more they can do in their homes and offices that was not there in the last few years. To us, plants give a new life to any place. They grow, heal, bring peace and warmth into our homes which can inspire how we live daily. On top of that, we live in an era where people spend more time at home especially with the Covid-19 outbreak. People want something that keeps their mind busy outside of work, something that is relaxing and brings satisfaction.”,The feedback they have been getting since the first lockdown is the satisfaction and serenity that the plants offer; watering them and seeing them grow day by day- people embark on a journey with them and grow together.,When making or choosing designs, the duo says they look at what is durable, attractive to the eye and matches the space they are working with. This is how they mostly find what designs, plants or pots they use on a particular house/project.,“Usually, it depends on the space we are working on, whether it’s outdoors or indoors. We also consider clients’ preferences, along with many other factors. We then come up with tailored proposals, sometimes we work with clients who don’t know what exactly they want; for them we share proposals and try to sketch for them so that they envision what the finished product will look like.”,They have learnt that many clients are not familiar with knowledge about plants, for example they don’t know what plants go inside, what needs full sunlight, what doesn’t like water, or what you can’t have when you have babies around because of toxicity. That’s why they give all the required advice to clients before they embark on any project.,In Rwanda, indoor plants are the new thing and they stand out because they bring life and beauty into spaces, the girls say.,They also noticed that that the trend of hanging plants on walls or wood boards has been picking up lately.,“Not so long ago, people only planted plants in gardens and no one thought that some could be hung on walls, or placed on wood boards or even bring them inside. I think all these great innovations are coming and they give us an opportunity to help people have them in their homes.”,So far, their business has been a success with clear optimism for their business to grow and become the leading and go-to-plant guru for Rwanda and other countries.,Nonetheless, their journey hasn’t been without hiccups. For them, it was the constant fear that they will fail or that nobody was going to buy their product or service. They however trusted their guts and hopped on this journey.,The other challenge is; they are both full time employees at other companies which makes it a little challenging to fully concentrate on this business.,“Also, some people in Rwanda do not comprehend our business and it could be a challenge to penetrate the market. There is a limitation of what plants are available in the region. That makes it hard to provide different plants to different clients.”,On the other hand, their cash flow currently only allows them to work with occasional employees which sometimes is a challenge when they have big or urgent orders.,They nevertheless look to the future with hope to expand their line of business.,“One of the businesses we have started working on is gifting. We started with a pilot phase by creating gift hampers during the festive season and we received positive feedback. We intend to share more about ourselves and what we do so we can continue growing in this market.”",business

I went on to play college basketball at Northeastern Junior College, then transferred to Grambling State University (Louisiana, USA) where I graduated.,I have always loved watching basketball. But I started really playing basketball in high school. Before that I thought I was going to be a football player. I also ran track and was getting college interest. (200M hurdles and High Jump) It wasn’t until my freshman year when I grew to be 6’4 I knew I really wanted to pursue basketball.,My rookie year (2019-2020) coming out of college I played for Apoel; a team in Cyprus and competed in the FIBA Europe cup. Unfortunately, the head coach who signed me left and so did I. I joined KB Trepca a team in Kosovo for the remainder of the year.,Of course this is around the same time the world started getting affected from this pandemic so my year ended early as leagues got cancelled.,My biggest games were played at Grambling State. A school not very known for winning before I got there. My recruiting class came in and played a huge part changing the culture.,We got the longest winning streak in the country for any D1 school at one point and competed against some of the best teams in the country like Iowa who have produced many NBA players. ,I grabbed 21 points and 6 rebounds against notable high major schools such as Georgia Tech who also have current NBA players from that team.

I want to compete at the highest level I can in every game.,Other than college, Afrobasket to me feels like one of the big stages because I am representing a whole country.  ,It was my first call-up. I felt honored to be called to represent my country. At first, I didn’t know what to fully expect but I was really excited.,My career goal is to be the best possible version of myself. You never know where this game will take you or what team you will end up on, so I just want to be the best possible basketball player I can be while helping my team win.,Having started playing basketball late in my life I know I got a lot of room to grow. Also, another goal/dream since I started playing was to play in the NBA.,The experience I gained is priceless. Like I said it’s a blessing to be able to represent Rwanda in these tournaments.

It is a partnership between the NBA and FIBA. For the first time the NBA is entering in this type of endeavor, launching a professional league outside of North America.,I think that speaks to the opportunity and tremendous potential growth of the sport of basketball in Africa and that is the reason why we opened our office in 2010, and I think all the work that we have been doing even before opening the office because we launched basketball Africa Camp in 2003 at the grassroots level.,Many of these countries have national leagues and the BAL is like a champions league model where champions from different countries qualify to participate in this unique league that is designed to really grow the entire ecosystem of basketball, to create an industry to use basketball as an economic growth engine.,And when I am here in Kigali looking at this arena where we are, you can just imagine all the business activities that could flow around having an infrastructure like this.,Our initial plan was really to play in 7 different countries. So, we were going to launch on March 13th in Dakar. As I said we have 12 teams, we divided the 12 teams in two conferences, and we were going to play a weekend tournament.,Like we were going to start in Dakar with 6 teams and then the following weekend we were going to take the other 6 teams to Monastir in Tunisia, and then the subsequent weekend we would go into Luanda, then to Lagos, Cairo, Rabat; and we would have completed the initial stage called the regular season and then the top 8 teams were going to qualify for the elite 8 that we were going to host here in Kigali end of May.,So obviously Covid-19 has forced us to change our plans and since we postponed in March, we were just monitoring the global situation with the pandemic and also how it evolved in Africa to try to figure out what is the best date to launch this historic league.,So as the pandemic kind of subsided, we were looking to launching the league before the end of 2020 with a modified format.,Rather than playing in 7 countries, we were going to just play in one location. So , , to have all the 12 teams here just like similar to what is happening now with these qualifiers (Afrobasket), but obviously the situation for us has not evolved enough not to present any risk for us and this is why we are deciding to wait until 2021; and it really had nothing to do with the Covid-19 situation on the continent and especially in Rwanda.,The government of Rwanda, RBC (Rwanda Biomedical Center) and the Ministry of Health have done a fantastic job managing the pandemic.,But the issue was how do we get our immense logistics here in the country because we were looking to put up a big show, something that really has never been done before.,We were extremely excited and our partners - the Rwandan government, RDB, the Ministry of Sports and FIBA were very ready, but we all collectively decided that let’s wait to give ourselves a better chance for maximum success, to launch the league in a way that we think it really deserves to be launched.,So we are working with all our partners and stakeholders to look at what is the best next opportunity in terms of windows in 2021. What I can tell you is that it is going to be launched within the first semester of 2021, it means before June.,We will continue to work with all our teams and FIBA and our host country to decide on what that date is going to be and I hope that very soon it is a date that we are going to be able to announce. It will be announced well ahead of time and that is what we are working on.,Being here obviously gives me a chance to connect with FIBA and all the national teams that are here.,Most of the countries taking part in the Afrobasket qualifiers, I believe, with the exception of maybe South Sudan, they have teams that will be playing in the BAL and I guess 40 percent of the players on these national teams will be playing for clubs in the BAL, so it is just super exciting to be in an arena and watching basketball for the first time in close to a year.,And just watching what is happening here in terms of the level of organization is very inspiring and gives me even more confidence for the opportunity we have in 2021 to do something special.,No, it is the same 12 teams that have qualified for this inaugural season that are going to also participate in the inaugural season launch. It is still our inaugural season that we are looking to launch. So, the 12 teams that qualified, they will be the same teams competing.,Well, we always talk about women and talent, you know, at the NBA we have the WNBA that is over 20 years old where women showcase their world class athletes.,You get global superstars that are brand names like Maya Moore, Lisa Leslie; and from Africa: Chiney and Nneka Ogwumike from Nigeria……. These are ladies we work with who are a big part of our effort to grow the sport across the continent and you many have heard that the NBA has launched the NBA Academy Africa in 2016.,We have a girls’ academy where we bring girls from multiple countries periodically throughout the course of the year for weeks of seminars and a camp, and a number of them actually have obtained college scholarships in the USA.,Since we opened the NBA Africa office in 2010 in Johannesburg, our main priority was to increase participation in the sport, and we cannot do that by ignoring more than half the population.,Basketball is a game that women play at an equally high level as men, and I know throughout my travel and involvement in basketball on the continent that the women’s game is more popular in certain countries than the men. I remember Mozambique always had incredible teams, in Senegal our women’s basketball team is iconic.,I was saying this a couple of months ago, I remember growing up, some of the names of some of those ladies that you listen to on the radio winning multiple championships then, and they were also students.,And this is something that always resonated with me, and for us it is an extra effort that we have to make, but it is just going to be a natural progression. Obviously we have to start somewhere – we are starting with the men’s league but I have no doubt that we will be talking about the women's league for the BAL.,But for now let’s get to the next step, toss the ball and have the inaugural season.",sports

","I was driven by impact. We have been holding this programme for over two years at the Champions Karate Academy. Then in June 2019, I had the opportunity to attend the 59th International Session for young participants at the International Olympic Academy in Greece where I learned about the IOC Young Leaders Programme.,While in Greece, I learned a lot and was inspired to even take my karate training with children to another level; that is how the ‘,’ programme came up. It is also in line with the third Sustainable Development Goal (SDG3) – good health and well-being for all. Thankfully, I also secured financial support from the International Olympic Committee to implement the project.,We decided to put the training in holidays because during off-school period, children are often wasting time watching television, or on video games, a concern that is shared by parents. They wanted a place where their children can be safe but at the same time be occupied with something that would benefit them.,Besides karate – which is the main sport, the youngsters also take part in badminton, basketball and chanbara sports.,Karata was chosen as our flagship sport for many reasons. Firstly; I am a karateka with Black Belt 3rd Dan, so I understood and its core principles than any other sport. Secondly, I am a long-time member of the Champions Karate Academy, so it was easy to secure venue for training. Thirdly, I wanted a sport that is less demanding and needs minimum equipment.,When you have uniform and a place to train from, that is enough to practice karate.,Lastly, and the most important reason, karate has great ability to teach discipline and values than most sports, and that is what I wanted the children to take from karate.,Our main funders are the International Olympic Committee (IOC), Panasonic and the Yunus Sports Hub who are the mentors of the IOC Young Leaders in implementation of our projects.,But since the project is aimed at making impact at community level, obviously we also needed the involvement of local partners and they did not disappoint. I thank the Ministry of Sports for availing space at the national stadium for us whenever we asked for it, and our development partner – the National Olympic Committee – who gave us an educator for Olympic Values to speak to the trainees.,And then, the Rwanda Karate Federation as a development agency of the martial art in the country, they provided us with coaches and top athletes to inspire children during training.,The project has really been a joy to watch and see the kids we started with growing and earning promotion in belts (promoted in grades). We also received positive feedback from parents on behavioural change; both at school and at home.,Most parents agree on two key things about the impact of our training; their children are now able to focus and accomplish the tasks they have been given to do at home and at school, and have gained self-confidence that allows them to express themselves in public.,Some of our young karatekas took part at this year’s Karate Ambassador Cup in February for the first time, and that is encouraging because they could be karate champions of the country in future.,A year since the project was launched, I think the Champions Karate Academy has been equipped with the tools and knowledge that will continue to be used to educate children and work with the IOC Young Leaders programme in future projects.,I won’t dwell much on what didn’t work because we have achieved so much to be happy about, but maybe I will mention just two challenges: Covid-19 disrupted some phases of our training programme, and the lack of enough local partners so more kids could participate.,Only this year, despite the coronavirus pandemic, we were able to work with 229 children – including 75 girls – between the ages of 4 and 16.,It is also my wish that the Holidays Karate for Children Programme can be permanent, and what is needed is just partners to work with and make it sustainable, and also the active involvement of parents.",sports

","BEHIND JASMINE KIBATEGA’S win and bubbly character is an incredible and inspirational story about her musical journey.,Seven years ago, Kibatega was a karaoke performer in various bars across Kigali, but today, the 26-year-old , a music contest that concluded last week at Kigali Arena.,Those who know the hurdles of performing in bars can easily understand that Kibatega’s journey has never been easy from the very beginning. In fact, if not for her love and passion for music, she could have quit the trade a long time ago.,Kibatega shared that singing karaoke started shortly after she completed high school back in 2014 but, for a girl her age, kicking off a music career in bars is always challenging and she was no exception.,“I had to control myself because I had a vision, I had a dream and, from there, I always thought that singing in bars…it’s for my exposure. I am exposing myself so that maybe any opportunity could come about. It was challenging, but I am grateful because I am here now,” she added.,Her love for music came about when Kibatega was at a tender age. She would always dance whenever a song was playing in the background. Her passion and inspiration for becoming a musician, however, started when high school friends admired her voice when she sang for a schoolmate on her birthday.,“One of my friends had a birthday and was like ‘sing for us’… then I started singing. Everybody was blown away and was like, “You have a beautiful voice,” recalls Kibatega.,“And I started to build the passion and love for music from then till this day. I started developing that love, that passion, and that was the only thing I could do,” she added.,Before introducing herself to music, especially karaoke, Kibatega informed her mother of the idea as she sought advice for her next course of action.,“I was like ‘mum, I really want to be a singer, I really want to follow a career as a singer. And she was saying, ‘Are you sure? How about school?’ you know how parents can be sometimes (laughs). But she was right!” the singer recalls.,“It was not hard (to convince her) because we have a strong connection. She’s everything to me, she’s my friend, and she is always there for me. Every time I wanted to do something, she was like, ""Go for it, get your own experience, and, from there, I will help you decide if you carry on or do something else. So for that, I am grateful to have her, it’s incredible, she is amazing,” she said of her mother.  ,Despite the passion and trying to help everyone at bars have fun, Kibatega decided to quit performing karaoke in bars in 2018 as she was only earning peanuts. However, in 2019, she reconsidered and kicked off from where she left off after realizing that her life belonged to music.,“I remember, most of the time, I wasn’t even paid. It was tough but I’ve learned a lot from it, grown so much from it, and… look at me now!” she excitedly said.,Her journey of singing in bars came to an end in 2020 when Kibatega heard of ‘The Next Popstar’ music contest and after winning the contest, the singer has no plans of looking behind.,“It’s now over. That was a lesson, an experience, but I want to write another chapter in my music,” she said.,Kibatega had no idea that ‘The Next Popstar’ was going to happen until a friend encouraged her to take part in the music contest. However, she hesitated.,“From the very beginning, I didn’t believe in ‘The Next Popstar’ because I didn’t think that in Rwanda we had that kind of talent competition happening. But she kept pushing me to audition for it,” she recalls.,She enrolled among over a thousand aspirants who registered to contest and she came out the winner of the contest, overcoming stiff competition from rapper Ish Kevin and four other finalists.,Upon winning the contest, Kibatega walked away with a whopping Rwf10 million cash prize, while the rest of the money will be spent on the production of her songs at either local or foreign music studios.,The singer described the journey to winning the music contest as ‘so difficult’ but with her mother’s presence, she was always ready to make her proud.,“Every time that they had to pick some people from a certain round, it was always a privilege for me because it built me up even stronger, more confident, and even believing in myself,” she said.,“My mum and my best friend, Peter, were around, and to be surrounded by that kind of love and support made me feel like I was going to win,” she added.,For the singer, winning the contest has opened room for her to write a new chapter in music by building a new career and doing her own music.,“To be honest, I am grateful for the past, but I feel like God has leveled me up to the extent that I can’t go down again. That’s an experience, a part of my past, and a part of who I am because it’s a part of who I am now. This is a new beginning, and I am ready for a new challenge,” she said.,Apart from recording a number of music projects under the support of her sponsors, the singer revealed that she already has some projects in the pipeline as she looks forward to using ‘The Next Popstar’ platform to build her career and name as an artist.,Kibatega gets inspiration from Whitney Houston, and the love she has for the American singer made her perform the majority of her songs during the music contest.",arts_culture

Gospel music is home to so many talents but which lack support and empowerment and hence do good music but with lower production standards and quality.

I have loved music since I was young, although I was not able to do my own music so I started from Karaoke in bars. Whoever has followed me during my journey, don’t ever give up on your dream no matter what people say,” she said.,She dedicated the prize to all her supporters but, most importantly, her mother.,“I want to thank you before the public. I am thankful that you were so patient, even where I did wrong, and for the support you gave me. We did it,” she exclaimed.,She also urged parents to support their children in their talents so they can realize their dreams.,Kibatega won the contest after two rounds. The first saw Yannick Gashiramanga and Honorine Irakoze Hirwa eliminated before she progressed to the grand finale as the lone female alongside Gisa cy’Inganzo, Ish Kevin and Jackson Cyiza.,Her performance in the second round earned her a vote of confidence from three-judge panel that comprised of Lion Imanzi, singer Aline Gahongayire and Producer Jay P whose accumulated points saw her win the inaugural edition of the contest.,Kibatega and Ish Kevin who emerged first runner-up will travel to the United States in June for a two-week visit during which they will be given detailed information about the contract they will sign with the contest sponsors.

","AFTER FINALISING its post-production project in December last year, ‘Trees of Peace’, a feature movie that tells a story about four women who survived the 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi, is finally here. The film will start showing during an online premiere from April 9-10, during the commemoration week., ‘Trees of Peace’ is the story of four women who find unity, hope, and strength through one of the world’s darkest tragedies.,Based on events during the 1994 genocide against the Tutsi in Rwanda, four women from different backgrounds and beliefs are trapped together in an underground room., As they contend with the fear of being found and fight a slow death from starvation, they are forced to reconcile their inner demons and put their differences aside to live through the day—for 81 days straight., American filmmaker Alanna Brown, the movie director and producer has announced that the 97-minute movie will for the first time premiere next month,  during the 27th commemoration week of Kwibuka 27.,“I think it's amazing that the film will premiere during the Commemoration of the Genocide against the Tutsi. Rwandans (and all audiences) can expect to see an intimate story of four women; it is not so much a tale of the Genocide as it is of these women living through it. I hope to make Rwandans proud of this representation on screen,” Alanna told The New Times in an interview. , “I made this film to honor the women of Rwanda, who I see as inspirational and as warriors. It's incredible to me that Rwanda has the highest percentage of women appointed to government of any country in the world and I want that fact to be more widely known. I want audiences to see Rwanda as a global example of progress after great tragedy,” she added., The project was conceived about eight years ago when Alanna was interviewing a woman who founded an initiative to help rebuild women survivors in Rwanda and the stories inspired her.,She began writing the screenplay in 2012. It was a two-year process writing the initial script, which was soon noticed by agents and managers., She then spent a couple of years meeting with studios, producers, and executives that loved the script but found the film too difficult to make., “During this time, I financed, produced, and directed a proof-of-concept trailer to hopefully attract financing,” said Alanna in an interview., Soon after that, Alanna ran a kickstarter crowd funding campaign to raise funds to make the film on a micro-budget., The campaign, she said, was successful, and then she began fielding offers from small production companies and producers to try to get the film made for a larger budget., These avenues didn't progress to anything, so in 2019 I decided to go forth with making the film with the fundraising money and I planned a trip to Rwanda., Around that time, producer Ron Ray reached out to her on Kickstarter after seeing a sample of her other work. But he wanted to see more of her work, and upon seeing the proof-of-concept trailer and the script, he agreed to produce the film.,  Within four months he secured equity financing from private investors and the film went into pre-production., The film was shot in October-November of 2019 but the post-production was delayed and extended due to Covid-19. It took all of 2020 to be finalised. , The film stars four main characters namely Annick, Mutesi, Jeanette and Peyton and each, according to Alanna, is a warrior in her own right but has demons that she struggles with, touching on our vast duality as humans and as women., The lead characters include Charmaine Bingwa, Ella Cannon, Bola Koleosho, Tongayi Chirisa and Rwanda’s famous actress Eliane Umuhire, who plays the lead role of Annick in the movie.  , Because the movie was shot in Los Angeles, United States, Umuhire flew to the United States for the production., “We filed and paid for her visa to work in the U.S. and flew her out to Los Angeles for the production, which was made for a small budget despite the extra financing I got. My credit on the movie is writer/director and I was also a producer,” the filmmaker spoke of Umuhire.,Alanna hopes to screen the movie in Rwanda, at the Rwandan film festival, given the pandemic permits., “If it can't screen at that time, I would hope to work with Eric (Kabera) to secure a screening date and time in Kigali for a public audience,” Alanna said., The film has so far only been screened at Santa Barbara International (listed by Studio Bilm finder as one of the top 10 festivals in the U.S.), the world premiere and the very first screening., “Hopefully we will screen at more [festivals) to come,” she said.  ",arts_culture

","BENOIT IMENA is a proficient and unrivaled artist who would make you believe that without art, the world would be a boring place to be. ,In addition to painting, realistic pencil drawing and design, the 19-year-old’s other craft is in making paper guns that are used in movies.,With his left hand, he sketches out anything his mind lands on, for instance; people, landscape, walls, nature or anything his clients want, and with a mixture of diverse colors, the outcome is amazing. ,Imena’s love for making guns started at a tender age. He was passionate about toy guns that his parents gifted him with some on special occasions. Like any inquisitive child, he sought means of how such guns are made. He checked out YouTube tutorials and before long, he had started making guns out of cardboards.,Some of his ‘guns’ have been used in local movies such as; “Killerman series”, “Major series”, “Pattyno comedy” and “Mistustu na boss” and featured in a music video titled, “Game Zanjye” by Fizzo Mason, among others in production. ,The youngster shared that it takes him about two to three days to complete one gun, depending on the type and size and each of his guns goes for Rwf 15,000. When it comes to painting, some portraits take him about two days and others such as landscapes, about four days to perfect. This is because they are complicated and require more creativity. ,He also recalls starting to draw as early as the age of 10. ,One time while in Primary level, a teacher asked students in his class to draw a car, but was mesmerized at what Imena had drawn. It was so perfect that he was awarded with a prize. ,In 2017 he sold his first artwork and that pushed him to do better. It was also the same year that he attended a school competition where he made an AKA-47 paper gun that left people turning heads in awe of his talent that he won the competition. ,On joining Ecole d’art De Nyundo, he was exposed to real art as he learned new techniques that helped him polish his talent. He was equipped with skills in drawing, painting, decorating, design and so forth. ,He has so far started to enjoy the fruits of his work. He earns money out of it and he has grown his network too.   ,According to the artist, it’s those little steps that keep him moving forward. He is anticipating that his talent will be recognized not only in Rwanda but also beyond. ,He wants to be among the artists that are invited to attend different art exhibitions and he is looking forward to building an art gallery to showcase all his artwork and teach youngsters talented in art how to draw and paint.,Imena also wishes to work with promoters to not only promote his art but also other Rwandan artists’ locally and internationally, not underestimating the power of social media as well. But rather use it to share the immense Rwandan talents., “My wish is to see that my guns are used in many movies and music videos in and outside Rwanda and I am optimistic that this will come to pass,” he says. ,Besides the costly materials, Imena says that some of them are not easily accessed. But also, he was dismayed that he doesn’t have any art galleries to display his artwork yet. ",arts_culture

This way, his songs will have a wider audience and bigger reach, since his fans and supporters are mostly Rwandan.  ,Earning from Gospel music and its challenges,Bigirimana says that gospel music is partly lagging behind because of the belief that the artistes should sing for free.

It is their biggest source of revenue. Miss Rwanda is 100 per cent private and it only generates revenue from sponsors and the public. There is a lot that goes into the organisation,”,“As you might be aware, this year the public is not allowed to attend the grand finale, so there won't be any gate collections.

They are really lazy. They release one song in a year but I release hit songs every now and then. You cannot find any similarity between me and those guys,” Bruce Melodie says in the audio, which has since attracted a lot of criticism from fellow singers and players in the industry.,Bruce Melodie made the comments at the backdrop of releasing his latest song “Bado”, whose official video was released on March 13. Whether it was a gimmick to promote his latest song or not, he has surely ruffled feathers in the music industry.,Tom Close is among those who have come out to openly criticize Bruce Melodie for disrespecting fellow artistes, who have been in the music industry longer than he has. He said that however much Bruce Melodie can hit, he cannot overtake Meddy.,He said that while it is true that Bruce Melodie is a good singer, being arrogant can be counterproductive, especially if he disrespects fellow artistes.,“You can do 200 songs and someone else does just two songs and hit more than yours. It's not about the number of songs but rather, the quality of the songs,” Tom Close said, pointing out that Meddy, for example, has a song that has reached over 30 million views.,He added that you would have to combine all Bruce Melodies songs to surpass Meddy’s YouTube record for a single song.,Meddy’s “Slowly” has so far been watched by over 45 million people on the video streaming platform.,Veteran former Family Squad member, Spax, who has been missing in action in recent years, also got out of his music hiatus to criticize Bruce Melodie, accusing him of ‘growing wings’.,“I normally don’t get on camera to show my face and speak about issues but I just came out to remind Bruce Melodie that he should not be too comfortable to forget where he has come from,”,“Meddy and The Ben took Rwandan music to the world. Their efforts shouldn’t be disrespected. It is time Bruce Melodie started looking outside his small circle that praises him and focus beyond that. Meddy and The Ben have attained international status,” Spax, who now lives abroad, said.,The comments have triggered a number of social media reactions, with some pointing out that Bruce Melodie is indeed hardworking compared to his peers. The “Saa Moya” star has been relentlessly releasing music in recent years, easily turning himself into the leading Rwandan artiste locally.,Ramadan Mupenda, the founder and proprietor of local music label, The Mane Records, also weighed in on the issues, saying that he finds no problem with what Bruce Melodie said because it is ‘his time’.,“It is true Bruce Melodie is doing great at the moment. You cannot deny that. His work speaks for itself. He also has the right to say what he said. We have to respect his opinion,”,“However, we need to have an industry where the role of legends or those who came before are treated with respect because of what they have achieved,” Mupenda, also known as Bad Rama, said.,He said that for example, even though one of ‘The Mane’ artistes Marina is doing well, she cannot claim to have surpassed Knowless Butera, who was already established way before Marina could start singing.,Faded rapper Lil G, also chipped in, perhaps, in a more brutal manner, stating that Bruce Melodie used to ‘mop halls’ where the likes of Meddy, The Ben and himself performed before he could make a breakthrough.,As such, Lil G, real name Lionel Karangwa, thinks Bruce Melodie should calm down and focus on work rather than disrespecting his peers.,Surprisingly, in an interview last week, Bruce Melodie had heaped praise on Meddy particularly for taking Rwandan music to another level, only for him to contradict himself in the leaked audio.,Both Meddy and The Ben are yet to openly comment on the issue.,Efforts to get a comment from Bruce Melodie and his team were futile.

It was talking about ancestry, and also new vision and the actions to create that development,” he added.,Swatez and Amanda have traveled the world sharing the power of creative therapy as a form of psychosocial support and jointly painted large-scale murals in 37 countries as part of their (just-concluded) project ‘Heart of Resilience’, teaching art and painting murals down the entire Congo River.,They painted similar murals in Kenya, Tanzania and DR Congo.,Before painting the murals, the duo would talk to the communities and gather information about what inspires them to get the right context of a mural they would be able to enjoy once they pass by the mural and have experience of the message it carries.,“I think the beautiful part is the people and their reaction style. Some were like ‘oh cool!’ and others were like ‘what is that?’ but, at the end, everybody really enjoyed it and were really inspired,” Amanda spoke of her experience in DR Congo.,“We’ve learnt so much about Rwandan history, about the current time and the future that everybody dreams or aspires to get to, and that’s how we figured out the composition,” she said.,During the mural painting exercise, Swatez and Amanda were joined by local painters Samuel Ishimwe Daddy, also known as Daddyism, and female painter Louise Kanyange, with whom they spent four days and three hours working on the mural. ,Besides the experience and doing arts as passion, Ishimwe said the week-long collaboration helped him learn from the muralists that art is more of passion than money as long as he is doing art for society., “With them, I have realised that sometimes you have to do art for people because the things we do are for selling and, in society, there are many people who can't afford those kinds of paintings but they need art in their lives, too,” Ishimwe said.,Ishimwe is positive about the murals on the street where anyone who will just pass by will see the message on the mural.,“You can pass by, take five minutes, go through the art and talk to that piece (of wall painting) and even if you’re sad, you will go home happy without paying,” he explained.,A similar mural had previously been painted at the Rwanda Ethnographic Museum located in Huye District, Southern Province, while the initiative could soon reach more museums across the country as part of adding momentum to a rising street art culture that adds to the quality of life for all citizens.,According to Robert Masozera, the Director-General of Rwanda Culture Heritage Academy, the wall painting outreach programme will be extended to six remaining museums.,“These mural paintings draw inspiration from the history and cultural heritage of Rwanda and we still have other six museums, we always have the strategy of what we want to take to each of them.

poet’s drive
","22-year-old Gretta Ingabire uses poetry to assure herself of the immense things she has to accomplish. To her, poetry is a way to express what is on her mind, convey messages that are aimed to teach, inspire and entertain.,She mostly likes writing about society, to speak about social changes that all human beings can embrace for a better world. But also, creating a voice for changes in women’s wellbeing, such as equality and control over their own lives. ,Ingabire started writing poems at the age of 12 while in high school. She started by writing in her diary on a daily basis, and somehow, stories started flowing., One day, her school hosted a guest-speaker who encouraged students to write—the kind of writing of ‘speaking without telling people whatever you think or imagine, or experience’.,Ingabire didn’t know what the guest-speaker meant but she gave it a shot anyway.  She practiced it almost every day, and was fascinated. With time, she learned about poems and writing as a therapy, and everything it adds to a person.,She has lost count of the number of poems she has written. Some of these include “For us”, “Like it’s not enough”, “Dear heroine, teach us”, “I want Freedom”, “Stubborn women”, among others, which are all on her YouTube channel (Ingabire Gretta) and other social media platforms. ,“My journey in poetry has taught me a lot about myself first, what I’m capable of and what I can achieve. It is, however, challenging because it’s still an industry that has a long way to go, but I believe it’s just a matter of time,” she says.,Ingabire is also a visual artist. She started drawing a bit early, around primary five or six. As a gesture of affection, she offered her drawings as birthday gifts to her friends, a thing she enjoyed doing and gave her gratitude in return.,Now as an expressionist painter, she did a course in art in high school at Ecole d’art de Nyundo. There, her talent was enhanced. While drawing, she uses paints, brushes, pallet knives, and so many other things that help her create something nice and unique. ,“Just like writing, the art industry still needs a boost for people to give it value and understand it. It should be a lucrative industry, as it is in developed countries,” she notes., Ingabire says that effort is still needed in spreading arts awareness and its impact on society.,She hopes that with time, quality art materials will be easily available in Rwanda, and more local platforms for poets will be accessible, so that spoken word poetry is live on different stages.,Among her achievements, Ingabire graced the International Conference on AIDS and STIs in Africa-ICASA in 2019. ,In July 2019, she organised a solo art exhibition titled “Spoken Art” at the Innovation Village Gallery in Kacyiru at the public library. This went on for two weeks and was attended by a number of people. This, she says, was one of her greatest experiences.,The show was the second female solo exhibition in Rwanda. Ingabire was impressed with the whole setup, and that she had to showcase most of her art pieces and their copy prints for those that couldn’t afford the original paintings.,According to Ingabire, the journey of practicing art is one that sometimes stresses as she feels like giving up, but because of her passion for it, she keeps going.,“This is a journey of connecting with different people, some that encourage me, while others dishearten me in diverse ways. But there is something I have learnt so far which is, if being an artist is all that I want and is all that burns in me; then I will just keep falling and bouncing back, it’s all I have got,” she says.,Her paintings can be accessed at Envision Art Gallery and range from $200 to $500.",arts_culture

magic touch
","He is one of the most outstanding videographers in Rwanda, with his name etched on most modern Rwandan music videos you can think of, alongside Bernard Bagenzi.,But Meddy Saleh cuts such a humble figure, you wouldn’t think he is the same person behind some of the most popular music videos we watch on a daily basis.,From the way he speaks to his meek demeanor, Meddy Saleh is the epitome of people who can be described as ‘calm and collected’.,One would imagine that his works, which have earned him celebrity status, have made him inaccessible, given his schedule, since he is one of the most sought-after videographers in Rwanda but from the look of things, the 41-year-old has not let it get to his head.,What is more fascinating about this is that he actually did not do any courses in videography -it is all in the love for video as a form of art.,“It is something I used to like since I was a child. I even used to lie that I'm sick so that I don't go to school so that we can stay home watching movies and stuff like that,” says Saleh in an interview with ,.,“I learned by myself. When I went to Tanzania, I met a friend who was from Burundi. He was living in Tanzania and he was filming at weddings and from there, I started to like videography,” Saleh recalls.,The filmmaker who was born in Gahini, Eastern Province, lived his life between Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Tanzania.,He spent his childhood studying in Goma, DRC during the day and returning to Gisenyi, where he lived in the evening. In 1994, his family moved to Kinshasa for three years, but later his mother moved to Tanzania and he also relocated to join her.,He returned to Rwanda in 2002 and met Eric Kabera, the organiser of Rwanda Film Festival and founder of Rwanda Cinema Centre. Kabera saw him show a friend something he shot in Tanzania, and it caught his eye.,“When he came into the cybercafe and he saw what I did, he just told me to come and so we could talk and see if we could do something together,” he recalls.,For Meddy Saleh, videography is something you need to do as a passion if you want to do it well. It is much more than setting up a camera and shooting. One has to use their artistic skills to be successful at it.,""First of all, it has to be a passion. You have to love what you do. Sometimes people think that videography is all about knowing how to shoot, take a picture and you just get money,” says Saleh.,For him, it wasn’t even about the money. In fact, when he started off, he worked for free in cases where artistes he worked with didn’t have the money. He fell in love with the idea of art, and he would propose to work on their projects for free.,He also continued to improve his skills by watching what other professionals in the craft do on YouTube. His big break came in 2005 when he was selected to take part in the Maisha Film Festival in Uganda, a videographer or short film producer.,It was during the seminars at Maisha that he met the now globally famous Lupita Nyong’o and did a short film for her. Although she was yet to hit the big screen at the time. When he looks back, he thinks that was his biggest project.,His other big projects include film documentaries for the African Development Bank (AfDB) and for Transform Africa Summit, among others.,Despite making a name as one of the biggest photographers, the journey has not been without any challenges.,“Sometimes people don't understand what we do and they think it's an easy job to do. They don't understand that we spend time filming, we spend time editing, we spend nights,” Saleh says, adding that it is for the same reason people don’t understand the value of what they do.,“I don’t think people give the real value of what we do,” Saleh says, adding, however, that the perception is improving because people now no longer go to South Africa or Kenya when they have big projects, as was the case before.,When it comes to working with artistes, Saleh says most times he has to come up with the whole idea or concept. If he is lucky, an artiste will come up with an idea and all he will need is to add value, but mostly he starts from scratch.,He enjoys working with artistes who are creative and can come up with ideas because it makes his work easier.,When an artiste comes with a storyline or storyboard, he will use a shorter time to get it done as opposed to when he has to improvise. He however believes that the future of videography in Rwanda is bright.,“The future is bright because for now there are many videographers and they're doing well,” Saleh observed, ably saying that currently, Rwanda ranks better among East African countries.,The filmmaker believes that if Rwandan videographers got the support they need from the government and the media, they would do even better and be recognised beyond Rwanda.,Saleh also said that the work of videographers directly promotes the image of the country, citing Tanzania as one of the countries where videographers are established and as a result their industry has grown.,Like many industries, Saleh said the visual industry, which is still growing, was hit hard by the Covid-19 outbreak.,“In the beginning, it was not easy, but now we have had to cope with the situation and we are now slowly picking up.,He has worked with several artistes including Yvan Buravan, who he used to manage, Knowless Butera, Bruce Melodie, Meddy, The Ben and many others. Among the popular songs he has worked on are ‘We don’t care’ by Meddy and Rayvanny and ‘Thank you’ by Tom Close and The Ben.,Outside Rwanda, he has worked with artistes in DR Congo including ‘Prix Decouvertes’ winner Celine Mbanza, Stino, Gaz Mawete and Cappuccino, among others.,He is currently working on a project (which he couldn’t name), for Bruce Melodie and another one for the Goma-based singer Stino.,-,On social media platforms, he is known as a doting father, always involved in the raising of his two daughters who he co-parents with his ex-wife, popular socialite Shadia Mbabazi, commonly known as Shaddy Boo.,Despite parting ways, the couple continues to co-exist, at one point even appearing in Yvan Buravan’s video together, leading to speculation that they could get back together.,“Right now, I'm single. I have no issues with my children’s mother. We understand each other and yeah, it's very easy,” he says when asked about co-parenting, adding that he relates to his children in a manner that makes them ‘Daddy's girls’.,Meddy Saleh has six other siblings – three girls and four boys.

As part of the festival, the film has, alongside other selected films, been screening since March 1 and will end on March 14, after which they will announce the winners.,‘Lake Women’ is about a strong, determined woman who finds treasure on Lake Kivu, begins a quest to form the first Rwandan fisherwomen's group ever. Breaking traditional gender roles and norms, her “liberated women” makes history in Rwandan society by turning the patriarchal fishing community upside-down.,Deve Shema, a Rwandan filmmaker directed the film. The inspiration, he said, came about after he read a ,, in this paper, about a fisherwoman in Rusizi who was defying all odds to fend for his family through fishing.,Throughout his filmmaking career that started in 2015, Shema has so far made four films, eight short films, and another documentary that is currently in post-production. ‘Lake women’ for him, however, is a unique and special film because it tells of the unbeatable resilience and sacrifice of women.,“There has also been a lot of improvement from the other films I have done in terms of image, sound and storyline which have come from experience and learning which enabled pay attention to details throughout the entire production,” he added.,As he explained, Marianna, the main character in the documentary, goes fishing in the night but one of the fishermen went missing and so the others were scared but she encourages others to go. The men start mocking her and calling her names, but the other women are inspired to join her and soon form a group that operates independently from the men.,As a matter of fact, he shared, his next film project titled “Black Widow” is also a fictional story about women and fishing.,As the only boy in his family, raised by his sisters who sacrificed a lot after his mother passed at a tender age, he explains, is the reason why he is inclined to document about women.,“I have experienced how much sacrifice and love women give, and that is maybe why my themes are usually driven towards them,” he said.,About the production said: “We shot the film last year at the end of February in Rusizi, Nkombo Island.  The process of the whole project took me about five months and began attending after a workshop organised by Rwanda Media Project. The subject matter was one of the ideas that I submitted was picked by the organisers., Luckily, by the time we got to the lockdown, we were already editing with the help of the sponsors. We however had to edit online since they had moved back abroad and with internet connection problems, the completion of the film was delayed.”,Shema was in Form Three when he wrote his first short movie script. A radio show that talked about movies made him fall more in love with movies. He then met with Jerome Mugabo, a scriptwriter who introduced him to cinema and taught him to write scripts.,After high school, he attended his first-ever scriptwriting workshop at the Rwanda Christian Film Festival in 2013 and later Maisha Film Lab in 2015, shortly before directing his first film, ""Running."",He believes the challenges for all filmmakers are the same, but Rwandan filmmakers have achieved so much given the age of the industry and the experience.,“We still have a lot of skills to catch up with, but it’s amazing how much filmmakers in this country have achieved, beating odds to win awards continentally and globally. Also, our audience is also beginning to understand this kind of art form which has given us a boost.,We have investors who are setting up the Rwanda Film Office and we hope to market our films through the office,” he said.,Established in 1992, PAFF's goal is to present and showcase the broad spectrum of black creative works, particularly those that reinforce positive images and help destroy negative stereotypes. ,“Because the festival is happening online, we will not have interactions and networking with participants, which is how we grow our connections as filmmakers.,Although we will not meet people, my film will be known through the festival,” Shema said.",arts_culture

","THE MERE FACT that they are twins is an advantage for Gakondo duo Ange Ndayishimiye and Pamela Bamureke’s traditional music career.,The twins were rarely seen apart from their young age. They attended the same school, in the same class, from nursery to secondary school. Till today, you can hardly see either of them doing anything alone.,Unlike today however, the twins were identical from a very young age that was easy for them to cheat exams because teachers couldn’t tell them apart.,“When we were studying in the same class, I would help Pamela do some exams which were difficult for her and vice-versa. But, after they discovered our tricks, we got separated,” Ange said.,But now, they are inseparable in their music journey.,Ange and Pamela, their stage names, have been singing since nursery school, in a school cultural troupe and kept doing the same when they got promoted to primary school.  ,They were at the time not sure they were good at singing until they discovered that they have a singing talent at the age of 12.,“We discovered that it was our talent when we were 12 years of age. The talent developed and we are now composing our own songs,” said Pamela.,Ange and Pamela enjoyed a steady rise when they reached secondary school at College de Gisenyi ‘Inyemeramihigo’, in Rubavu District.,One day the school organised a singing competition which they won unopposed. A one Augrey Rugamba had, meanwhile, been monitoring their talent since they arrived at the school.,He admired their voices and proposed that they perform with him at weddings at a fee and it was this offer that kick-started their professional music career.,Their first experience singing at a wedding amazed guests who booked them to perform at future weddings.,“We got many offers from that wedding, and that is how we evolved,” said Ange.,From their tender age, Ange and Pamela have been fans of music legend Kamaliza.  They attribute their fame to the late musician whose songs topped their list while performing at weddings alongside those of Cecile Kayirebwa.,“It is sometimes sad to sing and enjoy one's songs when you know you never meet her. I am sure that if she had been alive we would have learned a lot more from her. We love her so much, and we don't want her songs to be forgotten. When you sing Kamaliza's songs, she remains alive and people keep thinking about her. She means a lot to us,” said Ange.,Growing a career in the hands of Kayirebwa,One of the songs that Ange and Pamela performed at cultural events was Cecile Kayirebwa’s song was 'Marebe Atemba Amaribori'.,It was because of the same song that the duo were able to meet the music icon when she was conducting auditions for backup singers prior to her concert back in 2016.,Mentored by their school matron, they did a series of rehearsals about the song and attended the auditions., “We went on stage and began singing.  Before we could complete the song, she was already emotional. She hugged us, amidst tears saying that we were the perfect fit,” Ange recalls.,Ange and Pamela have since been backing Kayirebwa at each of the concerts that she has performed at.,The duo made a lot of money performing Kamaliza and Kayirebwa’s songs at different cultural events until Kayirebwa encouraged them to start producing their songs last year.,“We performed other people's songs and earned money, but never thought of composing our own songs. It was Kayirebwa who, before the pandemic broke out, told us that we should go to the studio and record our own song,” Ange said.,The motivation to do even more songs came after Kayirebwa admired the talent they had shown when they recorded their debut song 'Rusengo',“When she listened to it, she loved it and asked us why we had taken that long. We also noticed public's positive feedback was, which motivated us to compose other songs,” said Pamela.,Since last year, the twins have so far released three more songs including ‘Impundu Zanjye’, a collaboration with Kayirebwa, ‘Gwera’ and their latest song ‘Ndamurika’, which they released last month.,After years of performing Kamaliza and Kayirebwa’s songs at different cultural events, Ange and Pamela are now focused on pulling out of the music icon’s shadows and producing more songs, although they intend to keep performing Kamariza’s songs at cultural events to keep her music alive.,“We still sing songs by Cecile and Kamariza because we love them and their songs. We envision a brighter and better future beyond our imagination. Pamela and I can never be discouraged by anything,” says Ange.,Apart from singing, Ange was a model before she shifted to fashion design. She now owns a fashion house called ‘Hodan Fashion’ whose collections were showcased in the video of their latest song, ‘Ndamurika’",arts_culture

But we are negotiating with DSTV and the negotiations are in advanced stages,” Ndahiro said.,He added that the show is not what Rwandans are used to, but it must happen for a new experience to meet people from different countries and learn the different cultures from other African countries.,Ndahiro said Rwanda will benefit from the reality TV show because it will give the country big visibility as it will be followed by hundreds of millions across the globe.,“The show will hopefully boost the ‘Visit Rwanda’ campaign. It will be an opportunity to showcase the beauty of the country hence attracting people to visit the country,” he said.,Rwanda, as the host, will be having a representative in the Residence Africa next year.,The last time a Rwandan attended a reality TV show was in 2014 when comedian Arthur Nkusi and musician Frankie Joe contested in the Big Brother Africa season 9 held in Johannesburg.",arts_culture

She is the project manager for Ikiringo, a project that aims at protecting and promoting local dances in Rwanda. Using her social media platform, she is showcasing her project to convince the public to give her a chance to make it to the next stage of the pageant.,Another contestant is 21-year-old Linda Nkusi Uwankusi (No.32) had the option of working at her mother’s business after completing her secondary school studies in Literature, Economics and Geography back in 2019 but she chose to exploit her parents’ farm in Masaka, Kicukiro District, and started growing a cash crop which, she said, is largely wanted by both local and foreign processing factories.,Doing agribusiness is a rare trend for the majority of youth, especially those who were born and raised in Kigali. However, through her project, Uwankusi wants to change that mindset.,“I could have joined her (mother) business, but I thought it would be a good idea to exploit our land with an agricultural project. And I didn’t regret it because the market is open for my production and I am already giving a job to fellow youth,” she said.,With the Miss Rwanda crown, she believes her voice would sound more influential while mobilizing initiatives oriented in encouraging and engaging more youth in agribusiness.,“This is a sector that not only the majority of the country’s population depends on but whose volume of production is still smaller than the current market demand from local factories and foreign ones. With my experience, I want to show my fellow youth the opportunities and benefits existing in this sector so I can inspire them to show appetite in investing in it,” she said.,A lot has been said since contestant Lea Umutesi (27) was , in order to mobilize his 6.4 million Instagram followers to vote for her in the ongoing Miss Rwanda 2021 voting exercise.,A Year Three university student in Travel and Tourism Management, Umutesi told local media outlets that it’s no surprise that the Tanzanian singer showed her the support because they are ‘friends’ and that he sometimes visits her family.,She dismissed any rumors linking her to a relationship with the singer and said that he knew the singer’s platform would help boost her votes.,Kiba’s post has shaken the Miss Rwanda 2021 voting rankings which saw Umutesi go fourth, as it stands, from 14th, a position at which she sat before the post., A host of names in this year’s Miss Rwanda editions are familiar to the beauty contest, having contested in previous editions, failed but have no intentions of giving up the crown.,The likes of Hope Akaliza (Eastern), Teta Hense Musana, Evelyne Gaju and Claudette Umwaliwase (all representing Kigali City) are not new to the pageant after they failed to impress in last year’s edition.   ,They took enough time to follow the entire contest and their experience, however small or big it is, could help them go a step forward this year if they worked on the mistakes that previously made them fail.,Voting online is ongoing via IGIHE’s website, while SMS voting continues via MTN line by typing ‘MISS’ space ‘Number of a contestant’ and sending it to 1525.",arts_culture

","When rapper , officially started his music career in 2010, he was the only rapper on the scene in a gospel music industry dominated by other genres at the time.,He said hip hop in general was not welcomed even in secular music at the time.,“Technically, I was facing the same challenges as other rappers who were breaking through in secular music back then. But I think it was more difficult and challenging for me, starting from pastors and evangelists...to people in churches, you can imagine how tough the fight was,” he narrates.,Despite the challenges, the rapper knew that it was his calling to do gospel rap music. That’s what has pushed him to be the artiste he is now.,Though his journey had a difficult beginning, the Canada-based singer says that there were a number of people who supported him in churches, most importantly the media.,For him, the perception has completely changed in the last 10 years given that there are a bunch of rappers out there who are doing good, including the likes of gospel female rapper The Pink, and the fact that other rappers joined the movement.,However, the number of rappers successfully doing gospel music is obviously low and some blame the trend on the fact that Hip Hop artistes are not given the same treatment as other artistes, both in churches and in the media from which they expect to promote their music.,As a result, some rappers decide to switch their careers to secular music while others quit music because their favorite genre is hardly welcomed.,For Bright Patrick, a large number of pastors are to blame for the modest treatment of rappers in churches because they don’t support artists doing Hip Hop.,""Some of them don’t really value artistes, they talk to them only when they need to use them for concerts, fundraising, or conferences, but other than that. There is no other connection, guidance or some kind of follow-up, as a result, some artists stop doing music or go to secular music,” he said.,He, however, hailed some churches that support their own artists financially, morally, spiritually and emotionally, something that all churches should pick a leaf from.,Besides public perception that,ip-hop, whether Gospel or secular, is not well seen in Rwandan society, , says it gets worse when it comes to female rappers.,In a telephone interview with ,, The Pink claimed most churches perceive female rappers as just a rapper and not as a Christian who is trying to spread the gospel as the other gospel singers and that made her feel like rappers are not given value in churches.,“People were not used to seeing females doing that in churches…so of course sometimes I was rejected. It really hurts, but it made me think twice about why I am doing this genre. I am not here to make rap music famous in churches but to testify that God has been good to me and that Jesus can change people’s lives,” she said.,According to the female rapper’s experience, churches are on the spot having no, or little, room for hip-hop music just because of the bad perception of the genre in society, particularly in churches.,“One day I was invited to a church concert...and I reached there early because I wanted to leave early... I was surprised to see other artists performing before me, and at the end, someone came and told me that the pastor told them not to give me the stage,” the female rapper narrates.,“This also happened in one school where I was invited. The headmaster said I couldn't sing because I was doing Hip Hop,” she adds.,Despite such treatment, The Pink never gave up, saying that it was just a matter of time before the situation improved and that seeing a new generation in churches supporting Hip Hop boosted her hopes to carry on.,“People will stop judging, and even if they don't, whoever is doing hip hop should think why he is doing it and if it is reasonable, I don't see why they should mind what people think. For me, I do what I feel I have to do despite what people think. When I have a message to deliver,” she said.,Another challenge, according to Bright Patrick, is that many gospel rappers are not in the spotlight because they lack promotion for their music hence not many people get to know their music.,Eddy Kamoso, a local journalist who hosts a gospel music talk show on Radio 10, claimed that there are presenters who don’t play Hip Hop gospel songs because they are influenced by the beliefs of their churches.,Kamoso has been doing gospel shows over the past decade and is one of those who promoted the music of rapper MC Mahoniboni.,He recalls that some pastors used to ask him why he plays Hip Hop.,“But they had no control over how I was doing my job. To the presenters who have such beliefs, it’s not professional and I don't see why I can’t play Hip Hop songs as long as they carry the word of God.  I’ve been promoting local music over the past decade and Hip Hop is no exception,” he said.,“The mindset has to change from churches and then to presenters because Hip Hop has the power to spread the word of God, especially the young generation,” he added.",arts_culture

However, he still lacked a sense of direction.,One time, while watching TV on one of the local channels, they hosted an artist who explained how he was earning from his art. That young artist inspired Ndayizeye as he yearned to be just like him. ,He decided to use his talent to enliven the young generation but also start his own business, and he hasn’t looked back.,In 2017, he officially started his small art business although he still operates from his parents’ home in Gisozi. He has been able to gain clients, and afford art materials even though they are expensive. ,His challenge, however, is that art requires time and expertise to perfect, sometimes he is paid peanuts or nothing at all, as its market is still lacking locally. At times he works under pressure anticipating to be paid, only to be disappointed by clients. ,He believes that there should be more sensitisation about the value of art in the media, and from other platforms or concerned bodies, otherwise artists will still work under losses and ingratitude. ,When asked whether he would choose any other profession, he says no, because art is able to say things that words sometimes can’t. It’s a global language that anyone from anywhere can apprehend and be inspired by.,In addition, he notes that art is therapy for stress and mental health, like many health experts say. ,“With paint, or any art materials, I am able to be more creative. Art also assists in the development of motor skills (a learned ability to cause a predetermined movement outcome with maximum certainty),” he says. ,The cartoonist explains that if all people cherished art, the world would be a better place as art makes people positive about the future. But also through art, a message of motivation can be spread—making people achieve great things in life and focus on common issues for the refinement of humankind. ,He has started offering art training to some of his colleagues.

I have three songs now including ‘35 Bars’ a freestyle that I released in 2019, ‘L’Inverse’, which I dropped in April 2020. This one is more of a commemoration song dedicated to my dad and grandfather killed during the 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi.  My latest song is ‘Kuva’ that I released in December last year.,I would say tough, mostly for two reasons: It is expensive and it requires resources, especially when it comes to visuals. Another challenge is the promotion of music, which is even harder when you are away from home and want to market your music locally.,Not really. That used to be my worst fear all those years I was not doing music. However, people (fans) and the media proved me wrong.  Fans would slide in my direct messages on social media to let me know how much my music is missed and if I am contemplating releasing new music—stuff like that—and this is still happening even today. So this is my main motivation, and it’s a confirmation that there are people out there who still appreciate my music and need more of it.  But the interesting part is that there is a new generation that needs to listen to my music as well, I have to make sure they are served too.,I will keep releasing good music and going with trends, musically, and promote my music via local media and different social platforms. I believe that when you try to bring the best out of yourself, God also blesses what you do.",arts_culture

https://www.newtimes.co.rw/entertainment/hell-spreading-gospel-story-rapper-ga-yell," From ‘hell’ to spreading the gospel: The story of rapper Ga-Yell
","Those who knew Gael Tunga Rutembesa as a student at University of Rwanda in Huye District, currently Huye District, know the kind of person he was.,Rutembesa, 34, is a gospel rapper whose music is inspired by his past, including his years at university as a playboy, a drug user and a drunken young man.,But the story behind his switch to gospel music is undoubtedly a lesson for everyone who lives the same life.,The rapper who uses Ga-Yell as his stage name, decided to do gospel music to share his life experience and inspire those who might be living the same life he used to live to make them change.,The gospel rapper, 34, told , that he regrets the time lost during his university days, before he surrendered his life to God in 2012., “I liked to party a lot, drink, smoke cigarettes, drugs…, weed was the only drug, and sleeping around with girls,” he narrates.,“My university years were the darkest years of my life because I was living a dark life and it was killing me inside. But now I gave it to Christ, it changed my mind, soul renewed and made clean,” he added.,Ga-Yell says nobody advised him to change. It was just a matter of time before he gave his life a new direction., When he finished university in 2012, he returned to Kigali to start a new life after school, got a job but kept living the same lifestyle while in University, including sleeping with girls with no intention of getting into a relationship because he thought it would spoil his fun.,One day, he got a pregnancy scare and he felt like it was over for him.,“That wasn’t my first pregnancy scare, but that time round, it was different because I thought: ‘if this girl gets pregnant, her school is going to stop for a while’. I felt like a roadblock in her life journey, on one hand, and, on the other hand, I really didn’t know how I was going to support her because I was not ready to become a father, especially not someone I was not going to marry,” he recalls.,The situation the rapper was going through reminded him that he could find the right solution through prayer, his rare habit then, as growing up, he merely attended a Catholic Church only on Easter or Christmas.,That time round, however, he went to his room when no one at home, and prayed to God.,“A wave came by and covered me from my head all the way to my toes. In one second I was in total peace and I knew that I was touched by God. Even if I doubted, I could not doubt what happened to me in a second. That moment I knew God told me ‘I forgive you but it’s time to change your life,” he said.,A week later, the girl called Ga-Yell and told him she was not pregnant and, since then, he has been spreading the word of God through music that mostly shares his life’s journey.,“I gave my life to Christ and that was when I realised that my life is for a purpose and my love for music and telling stories inspired me to share what God has done for me in my life. The main reason I do gospel music is to show people that God is real because He is working,” he said.,Before Ga-Yell switched to Gospel music, he was an underground rapper in secular music.,But after deciding to carry on his career in gospel music, things couldn’t click right away. He had to wait for some time to settle for a new life and figure out how to thrive in an industry dominated by the likes of Israel Mbonyi, Patient Bizimana and Serge Iyamuremye among others.,“The journey has been up and down. It took me long to experience new styles of music, learning about the music industry,” he said.,In the meantime, Ga-Yell took some time off to build a life with a wife he married in 2018 before returning to studio, in 2019, consistently investing his time recording songs that comprise of his debut album, ‘What You Got’, which he dropped the same year.,The 10-song album is based on Moses’ story in the Bible describing specifically, when he used to cry out to God that he wasn’t able to lead the Israelites because there were still too many miles away from Egypt to Canaan.,“God told him [Moses] to use the rod to divide the Red Sea into two parts to find a way for Israelites.  Moses was able to do so many things with that rod and for me, bringing this into today’s life, I was trying to spread the message that whatever you have and however small it is, with God, it can be used to do great things,” he said of his album.,A year after releasing the album, the rapper released a seven-song Extended Play (EP) inspired by the first lockdown last year, when all activities were halted by the Covid-19 outbreak., “I spent a lot of time reflecting on life and God and I started writing new songs.,I noticed that, with every song that I wrote, I kept writing ‘In Your Hands’. And it was all about leaving my life in God’s hands because, outside of them, I can have so many plans but something like a pandemic may come and stop everything that, basically, I have no control over,” he added.,So, the best place that can be, no matter what happens-good or bad, is in God’s hands and that’s how the EP came about,” he explained.,His latest songs ‘Adam Saw Eve’, which he dropped last week and ‘In Your Hands’ that came out last month are part of the seven-track EP that the rapper is recording.,
	The singer wants to see his music spread all over the world and, on top of that, see it impacting people and showing them the way to God. ",arts_culture

At least in my opinion!,I have been a guitarist for seven years now and my early dreams were to play for Teta Diana before I ushered in on a solo career. Positively in 2020, Covid-19 reminded me to listen to other genres of music aside from my usual instrumentals playlists, acquired a new habit to listen to albums one at a time and drew my attention to ""Iwanyu"" album that gets more versatile and culturally rich as the genres, rhythms and message vary but going really deeper with diversity as opposed to how Teta is now mostly known for traditional songs.,""I started working on this album in 2017 and it’s fulfilling to know that it exists today and as a full live record. Any instrument you hear is a human touch and natural dynamics from a band of eleven musicians that we rehearsed together for four months. I really put in all I had from message, and melody to structure and Didier Touch whom I worked with for more than ten years helped with arrangement. I'm so indebted to the whole team that was a part of the journey."" Says Teta.,Music is like breathing, we exhale what we inhale but exhaled air smells differently depending on who and that's the beauty of Teta’s music. It’s like she listened to Richard Bona, Khadja Nin, Cécile Kayirebwa, Kool and the Gang, Chronixx, Toumani Diabaté, Rugamba Cyprien and Gonzalo Bergara Quartet sorta playlist along with learning history and living her own experience just to create “Iwanyu” album in its own way that it is.,Aside from being such a great musical artist, Teta creatively writes songs from day to day life experience, conversations and more. Like ""See me"" is a song on the album that calls out racism and is inspired by her experienceabroad. She also spends a lot of time researching Rwandan History as a part of her creative writing process. Her song ""None n'ejo"" talks about Nyampinga, (""Traditionally a girl who would get married to a man from the neighbouring hill to end the conflict."") a girl from a thousand hills country with rare ability to call the tune and harmoniously unite society. ,""Birangwa"", a very nostalgic song with such eloquent lyrics dedicated to his father and all those missing theirs dearly. Titled the same as the Album ""Iwanyu"" and poem ""Ijuru ryanjye"" explain why nowhere is like home, Teta shares especially her affinity for Rwanda's Gasabo surroundings. The tracklist goes on with love songs and her popular song ""Ndaje"" that talk about the history of Rwanda and encourage new generations to contribute to a better future of unity and humanity.,""If you're to work on album project that will last three years, you're surely going to face challenges be financial, geo boundaries and become more of a victim if you're like myself who doesn't want to let her creativity get limited by labels (because who pays for something ofcourse controls it) but rather keep on fine-tuning the process independently and enjoy the results as much because you know the hustle it takes"" Said Teta,I believe that you can't force writing, you need to be inspired first and if I run out of inspiration I would take time to recharge unlike being label's money machine. Also self-management enlightens me so much about the music industry and gets me better at it everyday. And the roadmap is clearer that I, myself get to know exactly who consumes my music."" She adds.,Iwanyu"" CDs are currently on sale and my signed copy stroke a chord with me by just how even creative and professional was the design from cover, lyrics book which features sign language saying ""Iwanyu"" and to the middle pages with Illustration that shows the harmony between Rwanda and Belgium.,Buying ""Iwanyu"" Album on streaming platforms and giving it undivided attention, is only a reveal of the hidden legacy in the making. Teta’s debut mini-album (EP) of four songs including recent release ""Agashinge"" is coming out soon. Know what's what about it.",arts_culture

","On Monday, February 22, music streaming platform Spotify announced expansion into 80+ new markets around the world including Rwanda, Angola, Ghana, Jamaica, Kenya, Malawi, Mali, Nigeria, Senegal, Tanzania and Zimbabwe, among others.,The announcement was greeted with optimism by many Rwandans on social media but more so, musicians and music producers, who believe that the music streaming service will be a good source of revenue for artistes.,Spotify is a Swedish audio streaming and media services provider, which was launched in October 2008. The platform is owned by Spotify AB, a publicly-traded company on the New York Stock Exchange since 2018 through its holding company Spotify Technology S.A. based in Luxembourg.,Many Rwandans took to social media to express their feelings, some saying that it has been long overdue, even though some people have been able to access the platform through proxy means.,At a time when concerts are still off limits due to the Covid-19 pandemic, artistes getting an opportunity to have their music streamed and get paid for it is such a timely development that players in the music industry have welcomed it with open hands.,“Among other things, it will help in maximizing streams, ensure direct payments of generated income without using third parties,” says Pius Rukabuza, known as DJ Pius, who is also a singer and manages other artistes under 1K Entertainment,“Artistes can now sell their music before releasing them in Rwanda (pre-saving) on Spotify,” DJ Pius adds.,Singer Alyn Sano, who has been one of the most hardworking artistes in the last year or so, believes the addition of Spotify is an opportunity for artistes to make extra revenue, adding to the already existing platforms.,“I just heard about it. For real it is a big deal because we are going to start getting revenues from the platform just as much as we were on other platforms like Mdundo and Youtube,” the “Joni” singer said.,Nigerian singer Burna Boy, who is among the stars that announced the entry of Spotify on key African markets, said that the platform will be very important for up-and-coming artistes who see what their elders are doing, learn from them and want to do even better.,“If the younger generation sees that the older generation is doing something and that they are successful, then they get to be interested in that thing and then they probably come out and do it better than their Elders,” Burna Boy said.,The “On the Low” singer said that Africa has abundant talent, all they just need is the backing, referring to his own experience when he started out, uploading his music on different platforms and people all over the world picked interest. ,“If everyone in Africa had Spotify and everyone experienced different music and different cultures, I mean it is important because the world deserves to have access to that,” Burna Boy said in his promo video.,Lee Ndayisaba, the founder of Cloud9 Entertainment and current manager of singer Bruce Melodie, said Rwanda getting on Spotify is a big deal,“It is big. First, as a country, this is good that we are getting recognised as we should. Second, people don't have to circumvent country restrictions to access the platform. It's a good step in content democratisation,” Ndayisaba says.,The same sentiments are shared by singer Yvan Buravan, who also thinks artistes will be able to generate some revenues through the music streaming platform.,“Yes, it is a big deal for our music, because its business to artistes and a way of support from fans to their artistes. And besides all that, its growth and expansion for the Rwandan music industry,” says the “Low Key” singer.,Gospel artistes also have an opportunity to stream their music on Spotify. Singer Aline Gahongayire, says she is ‘super happy’ that Rwandan music can now directly be streamed via Spotify, while Patient Bizimana also says that being on the biggest streaming platform will elevate Rwandan music.,“This is a huge opportunity for us as artistes. Spotify as one of the biggest streaming platforms in the world will help our music to be sold online without going through third parties as we were doing before, thus getting paid directly,” Bizimana says.,“For me, it is also an opportunity to think about how to expand my music internationally in terms of the language I sing in so that it can be heard beyond Rwanda and be recommended to many people across the world,” he adds.,Jean-Paul Nduwimana, aka Noopja, an investor in the entertainment industry and proprietor of Country Records, says that Rwanda getting on Spotify is a chance all artistes should grab with both hands.,“First of all, I can say that it’s another opportunity for Rwandan artistes and the whole music industry in general. Nowadays, the digital market is one of the best ways for artistes to sell their products,”,“On my side as an artiste and studio label owner, I am really happy. I encourage artistes to make their music and start selling it digitally. I don’t know well how Spotify pays, but from what I hear it’s one of the best platforms that pay well for streaming music,” Nduwimana adds.,However, music personality and founder of AFROGROOV, Eric ‘Soul’ Kirenga Karengera, says that though it is a big deal, there are other requirements that must be put in place for people to reap the benefits. He also believes that ‘small artistes’ stand limited chances.,“Big deal is relative, because we have weak legal framework, policies and regulation as well as limited support infrastructure when it comes to music and musicians,”,“It may be a case of adding Rwandan artistes to the list of international artists being exploited by Spotify. Let's not forget this is a B2B streaming service that mainly benefits big corporate structure with huge catalogue, big leverage, already deep pockets and top tier artistes with a gigantic fan base,” Kirenga says.,The experienced music curator believes those already big are the ones mainly benefiting from the music streaming services.,“As for Rwandan artistes, the more educated and digitally literate they are, the better tooled up they are to use the service to their advantage but make no mistake,”,“Spotify is not a cash cow that will pay you just because you put music there. Artistes and their teams will need to do some serious homework to be able to reap any benefits,” advises Kirenga.,In recent years, Spotify has been able to improve its mobile app design, usability, streaming quality, and music sharing capabilities, ultimately making it one of the best music streaming platforms in the world.,As of December 2020, the platform had 345 million monthly active users, including 155 million paying subscribers but that number is expected to grow with the addition of 85 new countries, making it available in 171 countries worldwide.

https://www.newtimes.co.rw/weekender/advice-my-younger-self-relationships-matter,Advice For My Younger Self: Relationships Matter,"Have you ever been on a panel where they ask you the advice you would give your younger self? It is a recurring question and a good one at that. A lot of career women who are now in leadership roles did not have the luxury of seeing female role models in senior management and executive roles when they were entering the workforce themselves. Today’s world is different: such questions are being asked and there are role models out there doing it all. An inspirational video circulating on social media showed Oprah Winfrey who answered this question with the following advice: “Relax. Be patient. Life has such beautiful experiences in store for you.” Although I am not Oprah and never will be, I share this feeling. Today’s article is my own attempt at answering this question.,Patience is a virtue. One that we often overlook or underestimate at a younger age. We are in a rush to prove ourselves worthy, capable or simply ‘enough’. We hurry to make money and to make a name for ourselves.,Sometimes as we are on this rat race to success, we go lightly over something that is incredibly important – especially to reach the highest levels of the career ladder – and that something is called a relationship.,Professional relationships are crucial because nothing happens without people.,Where there are people there are relationships, whether you acknowledge them or not. Trying to get the most out of the first few interactions to the point of damaging or even ending the professional relationship is not a winning strategy, it is a short-sighted approach. Want to power charge your career? Invest in your professional relationships! Read on and find out how.,Give first and give generously,Just because you do not have more money or power than the person you are trying to approach, does not mean you have nothing to give. If you are alive and part of the human family, you have something to give – be it time, attention, your unique perspective, a connection or anything else. Come with a proposal, a gift, or offer of help – not a demand or a request. The former is how professional relationships blossom, the latter makes them die prematurely. We often talk about respect being earned, but so is a relationship. It takes initial effort and continuous upkeep through both giving and receiving.,“A candle loses nothing by lighting another candle.”,~ James Keller,Support one another in important times,We are all in our own comfortable bubble – experiencing our lives and our careers from our own perspective, in our specific work environment with our own personal and professional goals. So my areas of interest, events of importance to me, topics that matter to me or moments that are deeply significant to me will be different from the experience and priorities of others.,If you value a professional relationship share the other person or company’s moments of glory, milestones and show up when you are invited. We know this from weddings and burials, for professional relationships it should be no different. Show up when it matters most to those professional contacts around you. Timing is important and the world does not revolve around you – just your experience of it.,Respect the relationship over all else,Honor the trust you are given.,So you have someone’s contact number. You communicate on WhatsApp and see their great profile picture. You took a picture of someone and want to use it in social media. Use your judgement and if you are not sure, check with the person first. It is not okay to take someone’s WhatsApp profile picture and use it in your next Tweet or in your LinkedIn post… check first. Don’t use someone’s head shot without checking if it is alright. It takes a little more time, but can save you a lot of trouble.,Trust takes time to win, but is easily broken. Do not take such matters lightly. For in the end such small needs come and go, but relationships – if valued and respected – can last for a lifetime.,“So, my dear younger self, don’t rush. Take your time to build strong, lasting relationships, as nothing happens without people and you sure want things to happen, don’t you?!”,Lucy Schalkwijk speaks and writes about the topics of leadership development, empowerment and diversity, networking and skills development.

","A glance at Inshuti Art and Culture Centre will leave you glued to one of the great pieces exhibited at the gallery.,The masterpiece, titled, ‘The Long Trek’, by seven young visual artists, tells a true story of Clementine Nyirabazungu, from Musanze District.,Born with disabilities, Nyirabazungu is a 15-year-old girl, who used to move in an old wheelchair, too hard to push due to its weariness and tear. Besides being unable to walk she also has a speech disorder.,Through this piece of art, they tell a true story about the girl who inspired them to create an inclusive centre so as to tell her story and touch the hearts of others to give and help others in different ways.,Godfrey Kalungi, Timothy Wandulu, Daniel Rukundo, Patrick Gusenga, Olivier Hodari, Solange Uwase, T. Pacifique and Bienvenue Mashakiro are the brains behind Inshuti Art and Culture Centre, in Musanze District, where they also hail from.,While in their 20s and early 30s, these artists’ story began when some of the members occasionally met Nyirabazungu on the street, begging for food and money.,Before that, the group worked as visual artists, although they would meet on rare occasions.,“Upon seeing her one morning being pushed in her wheelchair by her younger brother, we were captured by the state of her chair with the sounds it made on the rough road. We noticed this for a few weeks until one morning while working on the centre’s outdoor sculptures, we decided to wait for her to pass by so we could approach her,” narrates Godfrey Kalungi, one of the founders.,Kalungi, who is also the proprietor of the art centre, said they wanted to know more about her struggles and the brother that takes care of her.,Nyirabazungu and her brother used to wake up early in the morning to start on a long six hour’s journey to town, and at times they would go back without getting any coin, yet most of the time they went on an empty stomach.,The wheel chair had no rubber tyres, and parts of it had worn out, were rusty and had one front tyre, while the back metallic tyres were bent due to the stony roads they rode through town.,They soon realised, after visiting the girl’s home and seeing the conditions she was living in with her family, that they truly needed help.,This inspired them to extend their friendship to them and procured a modern, new wheelchair for the girl, which brightened the smile on her face.,The group then used an old wheelchair to create an artwork that would connect their family with the community.,Besides supporting Nyirabazungu and her family, the younger brother has been able to resume school, with the help of the group.,Meanwhile, the artists have also taken in a young girl whose mother has been sick of cancer for years. But the story, they said, was more of Nyirabazungu since they met her on the streets as well.,Since the inception of Inshuti Art and Culture Centre in 2016, the group has been carrying out community outreach to educate the community on art and craft, especially to the young generation.,They host student sessions in the creative part, and promote and expose dress culture and fashion in general at the centre.,The artists say they are dedicated to telling the untold stories of vulnerable Rwandans through art, training children in dancing, providing them with scholastic materials, offering painting classes, as well as hosting school tour visits.,They also promote talent, facilitate and lead student creative tours.,Apart from motivational talks, the girls are trained on making jewellery, which the group believes helps keep them occupied and prevents cases of early pregnancies, which are on the rise among young girls.,Through the centre, the group has managed to pay community health insurance for at least 20 people and offer scholastic materials to 32 school-going children.,“We also collect and sell crafts from local communities generating income and offering employment to some members of the community,” adds Kalungi.,To carry out all these activities, the artists say they use their savings from their art work and other side gigs.",arts_culture

It matters who tells our story and when our work inspires you, it’s important that you say it out loud and let everyone know that we are here and are making a difference. No one should erase the work of women,” she said.,Kakizi noted that the exhibitors will gain visibility and be able to express their thoughts with the world, adding that the public will learn from them.,“There are many subjects that people rarely talk about or open up about, yet they are important be-cause they play a big role in improving social conditions,” she added.",arts_culture

This pandemic has only revealed our true colours and they sure aren’t pretty. The masks and gloves are off, with well-off nations making it clear they intend to snatch every available vaccine.,At this rate, they’ll oversee inoculations of their nationals’ pets and plants before medics and other priority groups across Africa and elsewhere get a shot. And we wonder why some people are turning to herbal concoctions for protection! It’s the panic buying frenzy yet again, even though vaccine hesitancy and sceptism even in the developed world means they probably won’t use up all the vials they’re stockpiling, at which point someone will realise that the vaccines are near expiration and suddenly think to donate to Africa like we didn’t participate in vaccine trials! All those WHO cautionary reminders about nobody being safe until all countries are free of the virus appear to have fallen on deaf ears.,Would be interesting if the most effective vaccines had been developed on this continent. We’re often lauded for our hospitality and kindness so we probably wouldn’t hoard stocks because sharing is the right thing to do. EU commissioners who’ve been vocal about how their respective governments spent millions to fund vaccine research and development remind me of benefactors who throw their weight around and make all kinds of demands simply because they made a donation.

","Ange has a secret account that her husband knows nothing about. In her defence, she says her husband is an insincere person and that she can’t trust him, at least not with her money.,She says she set up this account in case their marriage went south. “I wouldn’t want to find myself in a puzzling state. I want to have options and not be tied to a marriage because I am too broke to live on my own,” she says.,Conflicting financial beliefs amongst couples are known to be a common cause for divorce, however, hiding money is a whole different kind of trouble for married couples.,When married, keeping money secrets from your partner is called financial infidelity. ,Financial infidelity is also defined as spending money, possessing credit or credit cards and holding secret accounts without the knowledge of one’s spouse, partner, or significant other.,Counsellor Shadia Nansasi says financial infidelity can ruin a marriage when it is discovered. ,When a partner learns that their significant other is holding such secrets from them, they are bound to lose trust in them. This is one of the worst things that can happen in a marriage, Nansasi says.,She explains that in most cases, people keep financial secrets from their partners to avoid getting into a fight over money or covering up something else such as an addiction or an affair.,“This can deeply hurt a relationship or marriage by cutting out the possibility for a couple to count on each other. Hiding such important information can cause wounds that can’t be easily healed, which causes deeper cracks in a marriage,” she adds.,Aaron Mugwaneza has been married for over five years now. His observation on this goes down to a couple’s intimacy or bond. ,He notes that such problems are often a result of deeper issues affecting a marriage. He argues that any person who does that or thinks of doing it should look deeper into their marriage for underlying issues that need to be addressed.,“For a person to do this to the one they chose to share a life with, there has to be a factor that is amiss. Hiding money from a spouse can be a symptom of a deeper problem in the relationship; this can be fear or lack of trust,” he says.,Author Chris Sonzogni reflects on a similar view, noting that hiding financial transactions from a partner can worsen tensions in an already stressed relationship, potentially leading to its demise. Why someone feels compelled to hide their spending, particularly once it’s reached a point they can no longer afford to keep hidden, may not always be clear.,As a way of overcoming this challenge, Sonzogni recommends for couples to default to transparency.,There is no magic bullet for overcoming the fear, guilt, and anxiety of being completely transparent about your spending. One key to developing the habit is enforcing a default reaction in yourself: open and frequent communication, without exception, especially if only one member of the partnership retains control over the household’s finances.,Nansasi notes that the best way to handle or avoid this situation altogether is for married people to have a clear budget that they follow and stick to as a couple. ,She also recommends approaching the problem with a rational mind and refrain from making accusations or fast conclusions.,“This would make things worse. Avoid attacking or blaming your spouse, don’t make any conclusion before you listen to their side of the story. Figure out exactly what happened and understand why it happened in the first place.  What is more important, however, is for the couple to be willing to open up and address this issue from the root cause,” she says.",arts_culture

But instead of irritating him, she would do all she could to ensure that he was okay.,He, however, now understands how damaging this is to her and he says he is doing his best to be there for her as well. ,Relationship experts explain that the mutual emotional give-and-take is called emotional labour.,To ensure that a relationship doesn’t fall apart, effort has to be put into it.

But when I brought up the issue she apologised and we are now okay,” he says.,Counsellor Robina Ziwa says though it’s hard for both partners to put in equal effort in building a relationship, it is necessary for both parties to make effort in sharing this load. ,She notes that a person is assured to be emotionally drained if they are the ones to always talk things out after a fight, or compromise their boundaries more than the other.,“It can be exhausting for a partner taking on most of the emotional labour in a relationship. But before it gets worse, you need to communicate and let your significant other understand how it makes you feel. This can be an eye opener because some people don’t realise they are hurting you when they do certain things in relationships,” she says.,“At times our actions are a reflex of behaviours or patterns we are used to. So, if you keep quiet thinking they know or do what they do on purpose, this might not help and end up damaging you and the relationship,” she adds.,She sheds more light citing that understanding that no relationship is perfect can also be helpful in dealing with this.,“Don’t be quick to come to conclusions, someone might be good in some areas but weak in others, therefore appreciate that as you give them time to adjust. Don’t be quick to write them off, view your marriage or relationship as a work in progress. This will give you room to comprise with slipups,” she explains.,The counsellor, however, emphasises the need for both parties in a relationship to make it their goal to be equally loving and supportive, noting that it is the best way to build a healthy and lasting relationship.,“When its one partner to show that they need the other more, or care more for the relationship to work, this gives room for toxic behaviour. For example, one party may take the other for granted and this can turn out to be emotionally abusive.”",arts_culture

","If you’re celebrating Valentine’s Day, chances are you’re grown, yet here I am about to tell you how to spend this weekend! By the way, I know you guys can’t see me but I just did an epic celebratory ‘Valentine’s Day falls on a Sunday this time’ dance. Not that I’m even remotely excited about the day itself, rather, the fact that being a Sunday and with curfews still on, not many people will venture out. For VD haters like myself, that’s great news as it means that should we venture out, we probably won’t run into smitten lovers all over the place and each other! That’s my hope anyway. I’ll miss the chocolate colleagues usually pass around though. And cake.,Someone save me a slice! I swear some bakeries make more on Valentine’s Day than the rest of the year! That may not be the case this year but I’m sure they’ll be alright. I was thinking though how great it would be if we switched things up. You know, do something nice for a stranger or someone you’re not romantically involved with or related to. If you chance upon those,‘Buy One, Get One Free’ offers, get the item/s and give the extra one to someone at your workplace or anyone you know is single or just lost a loved one. You can also re-gift certain things. My mum wouldn’t approve this particular one as she believes it’s wrong and rude to give away or sell a present, but I think if you’re not using it and someone else needs it, why hang onto it? If money is not an issue, do something akin to what some newlyweds do by asking their guests to donate to their preferred charity in lieu of buying them gifts. And instead of buying that hideous red outfit for yourself, (told you I’m a hater!) buy masks and other protective equipment for frontline workers or someone who needs them in your neighbourhood.,Skip the romantic dinner for two since you have to be home by 7pm anyway and instead, buy some groceries for someone struggling. Kind of hard to sacrifice your outing or getaway, especially couples who’ve been stuck at home for months and could use a change of scenery to get their groove back but still, what’s more fulfilling than knowing you helped someone in need?",arts_culture
https://www.newtimes.co.rw/lifestyle/making-friends-introvert,"Making friends as an introvert
","Introverts tend to avoid interacting or social dealings all together. Being the type that is reserved, such people never seek special attention and would rather keep to themselves.,But humans—introvert or not—are social beings that need relations with close friends and associates in one way or another. This is where it becomes challenging.,Jenn Granneman, the founder of Introvert Dear, quotes Laurie Helgoe, author of Introvert Power: Why Your Inner Life Is Your Hidden Strength, comparing extroverts to hotels and introverts to luxury suites. Extroverts can accommodate a large number of interactions that come and go, while for introverts, bookings are limited.,She explains that when making friends, introverts are looking for friends who truly ‘get’ them. “The ultra-chatty extrovert who parties every weekend probably won’t be an introvert’s best friend. We are looking for people who understand our introversion, who can go deep, who run at our speed.”,Jose Uwamahoro a university student, says as an introvert, she understands that making friends is not easy mostly because introverted people rarely speak or form relationships for the sake of it.,They look for meaning, which means small talk is a no-go area for them, yet this is how people make new friends, she says. ,She considers it easy for such people to instead engage themselves in groups or events that interest them. These could be book clubs or movements for saving nature, such can be good to meet people with common interests.,Another way to form friendships, according to Enock Mutabazi, is practising socialising.  The best way to overcome a challenge is by facing it, he says. ,“If you want to make friends, you need to improve your ability to interact with others. The best way to do this is to try your level best to meet new people, and most importantly be willing to interact with them, even those you don’t know,” he says.,Granneman, on the other hand, is of the view that if you want to add some new faces to your inner circle, you don’t necessarily have to head to the nearest party or networking event. Chances are there are already people in your life who you would like to get to know better. Someone interesting, someone like-minded. So start by taking inventory of your acquaintances—that new person at work, a friendly neighbour, someone in your writers group whose work you admire. Identify one or two of these people to reach out to.,Granneman also encourages introverts to go ahead and make the first move.,Many introverts wait for others to come to them. Having survived our share of awkward interactions, we may worry about rejection. “What if I ask her to get coffee and she says no?” Or worse, “What if he gets to know me better and doesn’t like who I am?” The process of making new friends can fill anyone with self-doubt, even the most confident among us. And if you’re an introvert who has experienced significant rejection (as many of us have), you may feel like simply giving up, she writes.,Granneman also highlights the relevance of asking questions. Inevitably, when we meet new people, we have to do what every introvert dreads: talk about ourselves. Often, this is enough to stop a blossoming friendship in its tracks, she notes. However, she adds, the conversation doesn’t have to be all about you. Introverts have a superpower; listening. So get the other person talking by asking them questions: “What’s new in your life?” “What’s something you’ve learned recently?” “If you could have any career you wanted, what would it be? Why?”,Listening takes the spotlight off you, and most non-introverts love to talk about their favourite subject: themselves.",arts_culture

","February is the month of love and Valentine’s Day is just around the corner. Normally, people tend to go out of their way to express their love for each other, however, it might be different this year. ,With the current situation that still has restrictions on travel and social gathering, couples are faced with limited options on how they can celebrate. Nonetheless, this shouldn’t limit those who are looking forward to making the most of this day. Below are a few ‘date ideas’ that can help you enjoy this year’s Valentine’s Day with your significant other. ,Author Emily Swop commends the beauty of taking walks as a couple. This, she says, can be after dinner or hiking together. To her, this can change up your normal routine; you can take turns choosing which direction to go at each crossroad. While you’re at it, step off the sidewalk or road, and explore. Is there a pond or forest nearby that you have never ventured into? Use your photography skills, and take some creative photos together along the way, she writes.,A special home-cooked meal has always been much more romantic than eating out. If food is the way to your heart as a couple, then spending time in the kitchen preparing a meal together can be a great way to celebrate Valentine’s Day. Take turns cooking each other’s favourite dishes, and when you are done, wine and dine together, this will also help you create new memories for your relationship or marriage.,Tourism is still open for those who wish to spend time, for example, at a park or game reserve. Book early and plan on how you can make the best out of this time together. You can decide to spend a day or an entire weekend as you explore. And for more fun, you can even choose a destination that both of you have never been to, this will help you get out of your comfort zone and have a wonderful time together.,Have a good time with your mate by simply playing your favourite games as a couple. Therapists say playing games can help build stronger relationships. It takes the heat and stiffness out of a relationship. At times, as a couple you need to relax from the stress and daily obligations of making a relationship work and just have fun. On this Valentine’s Day, let it be the day you relax and spend this time together, just the two of you. Showing love and how much you care about your partner does not necessarily mean spending a lot of money on fancy dinners or flowers, at times spending time with them can be the best gift you can give them.,Taking a hike is a great way to unplug and unwind with your partner. This Valentine’s Day, choose a scenic spot where you and your partner can enjoy nature and have fun too. Hiking with a partner is also believed to be an incredibly rewarding activity done as a couple and that it can strengthen a relationship greatly as well.,A move night is always a great way of spending time together as a couple, especially if you are both movie lovers. And as it turns out, there are also advantages of watching movies together as a couple, for instance it can be a nice opener for a conversation. This Valentine’s, make your day memorable by simply selecting a few of your favourite movies and binge watch throughout the day. ",arts_culture

","At first, I thought it was a thing for overly spiritual people, then afterwards, I imagined it could be a personality thing, but then I realised that the paranoia of going public about happy moments, especially relationships before marriage, is real. And it got me really wondering, who started this and why? ,We know that Adam and Eve should be blamed for most pains that come to us in life; cramps, job hurdles, name it. But who should be blamed for the normalisation of hiding beautiful things?,Why can’t I casually post a happy picture of myself with le boyfriend without necessarily raising eyebrows?  Recently, Juju la Belle tweeted: “Here is a theory that I don’t understand about keeping your partner off social media until you’re engaged/ready for marriage. ‘What if they break up with you after that?’ …Live every happiness as it was the last. What if you die today? Make yourself happy. Only You.”,It’s not like we are planning on dying, really. We’re here for a long, good time but it is ridiculous to hold our breaths till the day we feel ‘safe’ about our little happy world. ,While I was celebrating my birthday two weeks ago at the coast (even the memory of it makes me smile so widely), I took a little video of my drink, the saxophone, and the blue waters bordered by beautiful white sand. Oh, the video had nice background music too (Sauti Sol). A few minutes later, my saxophone mouthpiece fell headfirst and got broken so I couldn’t continue with the ‘birthday concert’. ,About an hour later after I had even ‘moved on’, my friend saw my status and he jokingly said that someone saw the video and spat, sending the mouthpiece to an early grave. I laughed so hard at that. But apart from it being hilarious, he went ahead and explained that several people do not share their happy moments, not because they are introverted or private, but due to fear of enemies of progress. ,I found this fact so sad. That we have to hide our beautiful lives and success in a dark room and even put a padlock until they ‘mature’. Businesses aren’t hidden until they mature, though. The minute one starts rearing chicken, for instance, they immediately send the word out without necessarily thinking about the enemies of progress. Is the ‘spitting ideology’ only customised for relationships and pregnancies?,I know this could also come from a place of trauma, and I truly wish you complete healing if you were ever in a relationship with someone and things didn’t work out. I was too, LOL. Back when I was young and fun. Heck, we even exchanged names on Facebook. It was an East African affair if you ask me. ,Looking back, though, it was a silly, childish move but I would not say that I regret it because it gave me so much joy back then. You don’t need much to make a 20-year-old happy, really and besides, it was the trend back then so we were cool and sure did enjoy it while it lasted. ,I came to understand that if one posts a picture of a young relationship that hasn’t reached the engagement or wedding level yet, the responses they receive from their contacts include things like, ‘why are you posting him if you don’t know if he is the one for sure’ and ‘did you get engaged and didn’t tell us?’ Like no, Susan. I don’t know if he is ‘the one’ because they don’t come with an ear tag, like cows. But I would sure love to enjoy every step of the relationship my way. ,Who introduced this ‘hide it till you tie it’ policy? It sure does need to be revised.",arts_culture
https://www.newtimes.co.rw/lifestyle/do-you-believe-valentines-day,"Do you believe in Valentine’s Day?
","February 14 will be Valentine’s Day. Also known as Saint Valentine’s Day, it is celebrated annually. Usually on this day, people surprise their loved ones with gifts, lunch and dinner dates, cards, flowers, among other things, as a gesture of love. ,asked a variety of people what their views on celebrating the day are.,Personally, I think a strong couple doesn’t need to celebrate Valentine’s Day to prove their love. Valentine’s Day has become a highly commercialised day of ‘forced love’. Quality love shouldn’t be celebrated on one day a year. Love can be expressed 365/366 days a year. What hurts is that commercials exaggerate it—they imply that if you don’t gift your lover on this day, you don’t love them, which isn’t true.,Yes, I do believe in celebrating Valentine’s Day. I know it’s a symbolic day to consider the love that we give daily and think about how to improve. This love isn’t only for relationships. It cuts across religion too.,Although every day is a day for us to celebrate our loved ones, just like a birthday or any other special day, I like to remind my wife how special she is to me. It gives us a chance to add ‘spice’ to our relationship, and I know how special the day is to her, so I do it to put a smile on her face. She does the same for me. So, if your significant other or loved one likes a little surprise on Valentine’s Day, just do it without over-thinking. The rewards of making them smile will be harvested with two hands.,I feel like it can be theorised. As we celebrate any religious holy day including Christmas, for the sake of giving value to a certain activity which might have either happened or been recognised on that day, yes, we then need to value what St. Valentine did. But again, this day seems to have lost the value we used to give it. Currently speaking, Valentine’s Day became more of a day for romantic couples to have fun, go out—more of a vacation day. On that note, I wouldn’t judge those who decide not to waste their time and money, and completely take it as any other day.,I don’t believe in celebrating a particular day for our loved ones, but I consider celebrating Valentine’s Day every day. This is because we must love every day and unconditionally. Thus, there is no special day to show your partner how grateful you are for their presence in your life, instead, every single day must be seen as an opportunity to celebrate love.,Business-wise, Valentine’s Day is the perfect day to raise sales, but family-wise, it is really pointless, because I believe that to people who truly love one another, every day is Valentine’s Day.,Much as I don’t mind the celebrations, they are not a big deal to me because one thing I do believe in is the daily celebration of love. I love surprises and if my boyfriend or any person I love surprises me, or not, I will still love them as much as I have always.,We have different opinions about Valentine’s ,Day but it doesn’t really matter whom you choose to celebrate it with. Or if you choose not to celebrate. It all comes down to one’s choice or belief. Though it’s a day to show affection to the ones we care about.  It could be a partner, friend, parent, or any other family member, a workmate, not forgetting yourself. This can be the day people reconcile with one another. Letting go of the past and what hurt them. It also brings out a clear picture of what love is about and caring for one another.,If I am surprised with gifts on any day, it still means as much on Valentine’s Day. The acts on Valentine’s Day should be done on other days too. I won’t feel bad if my boyfriend fails to do something special on Valentine’s Day because I know he has proved that he loves and cares about me and our relationship in many ways. Not making it a special day doesn’t make him half a man. He remains the same man that melted my heart years back. ",arts_culture

","The election of Dr Patrice Motsepe to head the Confederation of African Football likely marks the moment the continent has long been waiting for to turn around its game.,The South African billionaire is well regarded. He is not only an astute businessman but has earned his credentials with how he turned his club Mamelodi Sundowns from failure after he purchased it in 2004 to win the CAF Champions League in 2016.,The club is now the most powerful in South Africa with seven league titles to its name. This marks Motsepe as a man who knows his game and the passion it must take to succeed.,And he is not shy to say it: “I will not be the president of an organization which, in 4 years, will not have made significant, tangible, practical and accessible progress. It will not happen,” he was emphatic during a press conference after taking CAF leadership.,He takes over from Madagascan Ahmad Ahmad’s troubled rein that was plagued with accusations of corruption, nepotism and financial mismanagement. A PriceWaterhouseCoopers’ report had found CAF’s financial record as “unreliable and not trustworthy.”,The report points to an issue of governance, something Motsepe will have to urgently deal with. His 10-point manifesto anticipates this, along with issues such as ensuring competent refereeing and entrenching Video Assistant Referees (VAR).,Crucially, though, much will depend on sponsorships and strategic partnerships, which the manifesto also anticipates.,The issue of TV blackout of CAF games has particularly been galling these past couple of years. The termination of the $1 billion television and marketing rights deal with France-based company Lagardère Sport in November 2019 resulted in the blackout through SuperSport—the continent’s largest sports broadcaster.,It is not to put too fine a point to emphasise the disappointment, and that any TV deals should guarantee CAF income in all competitions— the African Cup of Nations qualifiers, World Cup qualifiers and club competitions— are on TV. The new president is well seized by this.,But there is the pending matter of the Cup of Nations, the continent's flagship event, whether there are plans to limit its frequency.,Asked about it, he was categorical: ""Total Afcon at present must take place every two years,"" he assured. He however qualified this saying the matter was not closed to a discussion with partners.,The idea was first raised last year in proposals by FIFA President, Gianni Infantino, to reduce the number Afcon is held from once every two years to once every four years.,Predictably, the proposal raised some uproar, the tournament being Africa’s most prized competition. The more frequently it is held, the more it might generate much-needed cash.,But some of FIFA’s proposals including initiatives such as to develop and grow women and youth football are reflected in Motsepe’s 10-point plan.,This can only be a good thing, as the future of African football lies in the youth while it can only enhance the women’s game if they are better included.,The larger picture is about higher ideals. To quote him, “Football is a powerful tool to reassert the pride, the dignity, the global respect of Africans, and Africa can produce and compete at the highest level in the world, both at the World Cup as well as the FIFA club championships.”,Despite grumbles that FIFA might be interfering a bit too much in CAF compared to, say, Europe or South America, one cannot fault the role the global body must continue to play if the continent must realise all the game has to offer. Recall that FIFA is composed of member association such as CAF from all regions in the world.,Motsepe’s election brings some welcome change in terms of inclusion. For the first time in its 64-year history, CAF has an Anglophone president.,And, in addition to increasing the number of vice presidents to better serve the continent, they now include a woman bringing to five from three vice presidents previously.",politics

","Nonprofit Organisations (NPO) or what is mostly referred to as NGOs are defined differently in various jurisdictions and sometimes expectations of their several stakeholders diverge.,For example, here in Rwanda, an international NGOs is an organisation that is established in accordance with foreign laws and whose objective relates to serving in the public interest.,Similarly, the role of such an NGO be it local or international should supplement the government to initiate and or implement new solutions with an aim of dealing with diverse problems across all sectors of the country such as health, economic sector, education, peacebuilding, environmental protection, services among many others.,While in Rwanda such organisations are regulated, merely this activity revolves around registering and the granting of legal personality whilst monitoring their service delivery including compliance with the laws among other regulatory roles - similar to most other jurisdictions in Africa; the subjectivity to a specific financial reporting requirements/guidance appears nonexistent.,Lack of a common financial reporting standard therefore instigates numerous issues including the confusion it creates for even auditors to determine “a true and fair view” without an applicable framework to compare with.,Other concerns may include inconsistent financial reports; high costs resulting from a need to prepare different reports for different stakeholders; reduced transparency – due to lack of clarity and consistency; and the perceived enhanced double funding fraud.,The International Financial Reporting for Non-Profit Organisations (IFR4NPO) project is developing a guidance regarding the development of an internationally applicable guidance for how NPOs prepare their annual financial statements, which can be adopted by any country if they choose to.,I am sure that this would be a great initiative for local and international NPOs operating in Rwanda to adopt this guidance once ready, similar to what their counterparts in both the private and public sector have done – adopting and implementing IFRS and IPSAS respectively.,But just before either adapting or adopting the guidance, all stakeholders including NPOs themselves, funders, regulators and auditors should participate in this process especially at the consultation level to ensure that the cultural context is well reflected whilst providing an opportunity to everyone to shape the future – each stakeholder’s voice and perspectives are fundamental in the development process.,To cite just a few examples emanating from Covid-19 impact, several NPOs appear to lack sustainability including limited emergency funds to deal with the current as well as the uncertain effects of the pandemic.,While this may appear cross-cutting to several organisations; at least in the counterpart sector, there has been an emergency fund to cater for businesses that have been strongly hit - which is a different case when it comes to the NPO sector.,Since this sector largely depends on aid and grants to finance their operations, it may not be easy for them to survive as it may require that they explore ways of obtaining new funding opportunities.,This could be a dilemma in itself when the funder has also been affected by the pandemic unless if there are, for example protective measures for may be local NGOs to be funded directly by either the government or any other donor to directly deal with mitigating the impact of Covid-19 to the citizenry.,Effective survival therefore would require, among other initiatives, heightened collaboration with the government and other funders – be it within the country, regionally and beyond; proper accountability and transparency – as a result of well-prepared financial statements that are more transparent, more credible and easier to prepare; well-developed risk assessment strategies including response actions.,It therefore becomes paramount that a common international reporting standard similar to what we already have for the private sector – International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and the public sector – International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) is developed for the NPO sector - bidding at contributing towards the creation of a more resilient and accountable sector able to attract, generate and utilize funds to achieve positive social good.,It is important to note that there is currently no common international accounting standard for non-profit organizations (NPOs) globally - it is only a few funding organizations that have tried to develop their own reporting requirements; other NPOs financial reports are often prepared under private sector, public sector or a mixture of both standards.,Developing and implementing a common Guidance will greatly contribute to enhanced accountability and decision making beneficial to all stakeholders including donors and governments where such NPOs operate. Other objectives of the Project also include the addressing of specific NPO issues to promote comparability of NPO financial reports and improving the quality, transparency and credibility of NPO financial reports. Preparing accrual based financial reports could be one of the quicker means for additional funding due to heightened trust and confidence of the NPO activities.,More so, the other important outcome from this Project that has never existed before, is an establishment of a global community of stakeholders able to engage and collaborate to solve sector-wide issues; For NPOs applying the Guidance, it means they will be better able to demonstrate their capacity and attract funds, as well as supporting the provision of decision useful information for governance and management. ,For funders it contributes to better and more efficient due diligence, which is a win for NPOs too.  And having clear guidance simplifies and improves the value of audit assurance.,Ultimately, it is believed that the Guidance will contribute to a more resilient and accountable sector that is better able to attract, generate and utilize funds to achieve positive social good.,Please do your part by contributing to the Consultation Paper as the initial step in developing a common Guidance for NPOs by visiting ,.,.",politics

","Everyone, even sceptics and optimists, agree that these are truly hard times. All recognise the disruption of practically all aspects of life and the uncertainty about when things will return to normal. What’s perhaps different is how people respond to the times.,We humans are generally a complaining lot whatever the circumstances. In good times and bad we will go on about things not going quite right and blame everyone else but themselves.,Hard times bring out these dissatisfactions in stark relief, even those that appear unconnected to the moment. Most people will complain more than usual but do little more. It is human nature, I suppose, or at any rate that’s what we say.,A few, however, gird themselves to confront the difficult times and try to get the better of them. These, we say, are exceptional as if to say that what they have done is not expected of them or is not human nature. That also is, well, human nature.,Given a choice, some of those complaining would rather live elsewhere than their countries. That’s the impression one gets from comments in the media and other public utterances in the region, often amplified or originated by foreign media.,Most of the dissatisfaction is with leaders and governments. You hear this, for instance, the leaders are selfish and uncaring, except for their families and friends. They even take the Covid-19 vaccine in secret while the rest are left to cope as best they can.,Or they bemoan the ramshackle or non-existent public social infrastructure, especially health and education, and say it is no wonder it’s like that because the leaders have no need for it. They go to private hospitals or travel abroad for medical needs.,They raise the alarm about their leaders looting of national wealth. Or foreigners doing so. Often, both in collusion.,Their systems don’t work or they are opaque and inefficient. They complain of information blackouts that keep citizens in the dark about so many issues.,These complaints and more have been loudest in these Covid-19 times. Of course all the things being grumbled about are not new. They have been there, in the open or under the surface unseen because, well, they were covered. Now Covid-19 has removed the lid in more senses than one.,And so, some of the citizens of these countries where dissatisfaction is strongest would probably want away if they had the option.,Not so some of us. We would not exchange this little paradise (admittedly still in the making) for anywhere else. If I were ever asked where I would want to live in times like these, the answer would be quick and simple. In a place that assures me of my safety, provides certainty, where matters are predictable, where I would not be shocked or surprised by every happening. That place is Rwanda.,I have seen or heard of fewer places where they recognise any threat immediately and quickly take appropriate action to protect citizens and foreigners on its soil. The measures may sometimes be very tough and painful but we stick to them because they have been explained.,We may be asked to make sacrifices, forgo some pleasures, even rights, but we do so willingly because we know it is all in the common interest, the collective safety of all. They are not demands based on someone’s whims or the caprices of another.,Of course, there will always be some who grumble. That’s to be expected. It would be an unfamiliar world without grumblers. You might say again it is also part of human nature.,Only in few places would everything possible be done to mitigate the effects of the painful measures. These actions extend to animals, especially those genetically closest to us.,I am sure you would also want to live in a place, where when remedies to such threats as the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic become available, it is among the first to get and use them. The moment vaccines were obtained this country was able to immediately inoculate people of all classes and nationalities on Rwandan soil, even prison inmates, including those that have visited terror on the land. Where else have you heard that happen?,All of which make me wonder: with all these people-inspired actions, where do some people find all those horrible things they say and write about our country and leaders? If I knew how I would curse them so that the words would dry in their throats and become stiff on their fingers. But I don’t and can only urge them to open their eyes and hearts and see what there is.,Whether they see the light or not, we are happy to live in a country that is always ready to respond to any circumstances in order to keep its people safe.    ",politics

","Agriculture matters. It’s the biggest employer in Sub-Saharan Africa, and a more effective way to lift people out of poverty is yet to emerge. But amongst economic sectors, agriculture is the most significant water user and the ,.,As natural forests give way for agriculture and other types of development, the Earth ,.,Inevitably, it is left vulnerable to climate change, desertification, increased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and a host of other problems.,In such scenarios where people’s livelihoods compete with nature itself, the benefits that trees provide can be best sustained by integrating their growth into agriculturally-productive landscapes. Agroforestry – which entails growing trees among or around food crops – is a proven method for farmers to grow more diverse, productive, and profitable crops while protecting the environment by reducing farmers’ reliance on forests. And as climate variability increases, farm families need assets to cope with shocks and make productive investments to uplift their living standards. ,Agroforestry attempts to balance several needs: to grow a diverse, adequate supply of food both that can meet national and global demands and satisfy the needs of the producers themselves; to grow trees for food, timber, and other commercial purposes; and to protect the natural environment to ensure it continues to provide resources to meet the needs of present and future generations.,Along with its farm and landscape-level environmental benefits, tree-planting is the most important non-crop asset for livelihoods for the world’s rural poor. Over the last decade, One Acre Fund, the agricultural non-profit I work with, collaborated with more than 990,000 farmers in nine countries to plant 40 million trees.,These include fruit trees, such as avocado, which constitute an important part of farming in Rwanda. Our research has shown that a small Rwf1,800 investment in tree seedlings can return 40 times as much – about Rwf73,805 – after 10 years when a mature timber tree is harvested. But despite increased interest globally in forestry, most large-scale efforts often bypass smallholders to focus on commercial plantations.,While many farmers know how to farm with trees and understand the benefits of agroforestry, more often than not, intended interventions fail to account for the social context and values, limiting their adoption and uptake. For example, some farmers are reluctant to plant trees because they associate trees with forests, not agriculture. Others fear that trees will out-compete crops for nutrients when grown together. How then can we encourage agroforestry amongst farming communities to promote tree planting interventions within agriculture?,My organization is championing the planting of one billion trees in farmlands across Sub-Saharan Africa. Using knowledge obtained through years of research, proven agroforestry systems, and practices, One Acre Fund is driving one of the biggest agroforestry efforts for smallholder farmers in six countries, where we aim to plant 250 million trees cumulatively by 2024 and one billion trees by 2030. In doing so, we will not only be responding to climatic needs but also project to generate more than $130.6 million in farmer revenue in 2024 alone.,In our experience, successful tree planting initiatives depend on the soil, farm context, and farmers’ goals. From the type of tree to plant, where to plant it, and attendant benefits, our tree projects are supported by rigorous research that ensures both farmers and the environment benefit. To ensure consistent results across the board, and to secure the benefits of trees for as many farmers as possible, we regularly partner with the government and the private sector in all our countries of operation.,From our research, adoption requires consistent communication – drawing success stories that illustrate how others use agroforestry, and fostering personal communication between farmers to learn from one another. What is more, peer-to-peer influence can change attitudes towards agroforestry. When farmers see their neighbours’ success, they are more likely to adopt agroforestry. And with time, their perception of the values of trees in agriculture can change.,In the longer-term, even though the decision on what to grow is up to individual farmers, their choices are influenced by the decisions and beliefs of entities such as local authorities and leadership, and community-based organizations. These powerful local actors can play key roles in the adoption of agroforestry programs that partner with community institutions, like farmer groups, to significantly increase the success of agroforestry efforts.,Lastly, government support plays a vital role in facilitating the uptake of agroforestry knowledge and practice. This is especially true for the policy and institutional context within which agroforestry is practiced. Specifically, governments can help revise outdated texts in terms of forestry and environmental legislation, improve tree crop value chains, provide technical support for the diversification of farming practices, and stronger coordination and cross-sectoral integration between agriculture, environmental, rural development, and business initiatives.",politics

","The moment “The Bulldozer” – Magufuli’s nickname for his hard work – became president, he hit the ground, burrowed into its leadership mire and twisted up everything like a tropical cyclone.,The accepted laid-back way of working, absenteeism, ghost-salary-earning, sloth, the canker of corruption and embezzlement, plus other vices, ‘The Bulldozer/Cyclone’ sent them all into a spiralling pointed-rock that hung over Tanzania like a giant sword.,The perform-or-perish tremor touched off was felt within the country as it was, without.,Cynics in Africa and beyond dismissed his ways as a lot of bombast and blaster.,They’d seen it with the likes of Uganda’s Idi Amin and some initially credible revolutionaries, especially with a military background, who promised fundamental changes that would birth a better future, only for their momentum to peter out and many times sink their rule into worse rot.,However, optimists who believe in the eventual rise of Africa rejoiced in the arrival on the scene of a man marked by a sense of urgency in the service of his people. It was refreshing to have a man committed to positive action far removed from the sort who hunger for foreign favours at the expense of national, regional and continental progress.,These are the sort that work solely for self-preservation where their people’s strife festers under their noses. Be they inter-tribal, regional, religious infightings or poverty, disease and squalor, these quislings are too busy licking foreigners’ boots to address them.,In Africa that’s peppered with such self-seeking leaderships, Magufuli was a breath of fresh air.,With his avowed “Hapa Kazi Tu!” that’d be transliterated to “Men/Women At Work Here!”, he buried himself into his task with the impatience of a man who had for long borne testimony to leaderships that did not apply themselves to their fullest potential.,His country needed to move. And fast. Magufuli, the veritable workhorse, stepped on the gas.,He oversaw the retrenchment of civil servants with fake papers, the removal from the payroll of thousands of ghost workers, prompt salary payment to public service workers, the clearance of old-file caseloads in courts and the reduction in the incidence of graft. He saw to it that Tanzanians enjoyed permanent sovereignty over their country’s natural resources.,Education in primary and secondary schools was provided free. Electricity saw great expansion as did access to clean water. To the existing number of healthcare facilities were added over one thousand more.,The economy saw inflation contained while the tax collection base was pushed up and debt levels pulled down. Industrial production was intensified and exports rose. From a crawl, the country raced and achieved lower middle income status.,The existing road network has increased many times over and the ports of Dar-es-Salaam, Tanga and Mtwara have been enlarged to handle more load capacity.,With Magufuli, Tanzanians have certainly made many developmental achievements and there are still many projects that, when completed, will be of great benefit to the country and the region. Among these projects is the Standard Gauge Railway whose completion Rwandans eagerly await.,Of course, ‘The Bulldozer’ had a very big Achilles’ heel. He never realised that Tanzania could not live in a silo. That it had to actively engage the continent and the world, if for nothing else, to assert the continent’s dignity for equal partnership with other continents.,Denying the existence of Covid-19 and dismissing it as a cruel creation of the West that could vanish in the face of crude indigenous potions was surely a fatal mistake. When all global communities were crying “Devastation!” trying to attain progress without addressing it was an effort in futility.,All Magufuli needed was to effect citizen-centred leadership where he’d be guided as he’d guide, to avert the above ills. With his ears connected to Tanzanians of all categories, he could also have found a way of accommodating opposition politicians and critical media personalities.,As if the Rwanda I am talking from does not share the same Western flak in that area, I can hear some of you sneer! However, there is a difference in where the two countries are coming from.,Show me a Rwandan oppositionist politician or critical journalist who differed with the government on policy and I’ll show you a man or woman who was drafted into government or enjoys all media freedoms. Otherwise peddling retrogressive divisionism tactics, genocide ideology or resorting to terror acts are all in contravention of the laws of this land.,Tanzania, having enjoyed a history of relative peace this far, is not victim to such criminal poseurs.,But we are celebrating the life of a man who pushed Tanzania to remarkable heights of progress within the short span of five years. As he took us all by pleasant surprise at every turn, how many surprises would he have sprung if the Almighty he believed in had allowed him to serve his term?,As President Samia Suluhu Hassan steps into his giant shoes, she’ll do well to consult an equally hard-work-focused tiny neighbour to her country’s north-west, as did Magufuli.",politics
https://www.newtimes.co.rw/opinions/rras-effort-impose-mandatory-ebm-invoices-now-affects-all-businesses,"RRA’s effort to impose mandatory EBM invoices now affects all businesses
","A recent announcement from the Commissioner-General (CG) of the Rwanda Revenue Authority (RRA) impacts businesses and other entities claiming tax deductions associated with expenses.,From 1 January 2021 onwards, certain non-VAT registered taxpayers must provide invoices/receipts generated by an Electronic Invoicing System (EIS) - commonly known as EBM - as documentation to support their tax deduction claims.,Although there are a number of challenges with implementing this directive, overall the CG’s announcement should serve RRA’s objective of broadening the uptake of EISs. Since 2013, EISs have helped VAT-registered taxpayers in Rwanda to improve bookkeeping and Value Added Tax (VAT) compliance.,All VAT-registered businesses must provide customers with a certified VAT receipt and as of this writing, approximately 95% of all VAT registered suppliers have an EIS to generate these receipts.,RRA is currently developing a number of software solutions to improve the accessibility, convenience and accuracy of EIS processes. The new EIS applications will be mobile accessible and provide web-based invoicing and online integration with taxpayers’ invoicing systems.,RRA plans to get to the point where audit and tax collections would rely substantially on data analytics derived from EIS data. Going forward, we are likely to see more ‘benchmark audits’ establishing taxpayers’ true sales patterns, using data analytics to flag taxpayers deviating from this pattern and potentially triggering automatic ‘mystery shopper’ audits to verify non-compliance among taxpayers.,Certainly RRA has a tall order of expectations to meet. Modernizing RRA service delivery, broadening the tax base, enforcing tax compliance and supporting development through effective, data-driven tax revenue collection are not idle concerns. Even so, the CG’s announcement requires clarification in a number of areas and, through a process of public engagement, these clarifications have already helped to address some sticky issues.,One challenge associated with extending the scope of EIS to corporate income tax is that not all expenses are supportable by invoices. RRA has clarified by indicating that certain expenses which can be validated through other means, such as payroll costs indicated by PAYE declarations and imported service costs indicated by withholding tax declarations, may qualify for deduction without EIS receipts. Costs associated with the transport of imported goods should be supported by invoices which can be stamped and validated by customs officials, even if the transporters themselves do not issue EIS receipts.,Recently, the CG has issued a series of industry-specific announcements that intend to clarify, streamline and support tax compliance for taxpayers operating in the construction and agriculture sectors. In agriculture, RRA has acknowledged that non-commercial and non-registered small-hold farmers may supply cooperatives, traders or processing factories without issuing EIS invoices/receipts, whereas their trading partners can still benefit from taxable income deductions provided that they keep detailed records of transactions with these farmers. Additionally, a new category of supplies (category D) in EIS software has been introduced which would apply to certain small- and medium-sized entities as non-VAT registered taxpayers and enable them to issue EIS invoices without having to register for VAT.,RRA is likely to continue issuing additional announcements and updates as needed. One sector that would benefit from urgent clarification is the NGO sector. Most NGOs are not in commercial trading and therefore don’t have or need EIS, but RRA could validate the sponsorships/donations received by NGOs through the annual financial statements that they submit and therefore not require them to issue EIS receipts to donors/sponsors.,Another challenge is of a legal nature. Whereas Rwanda’s Tax Procedures Law requires persons who carry out taxable activities to issue invoices generated by EIS, the deductibility of expenses is actually governed by the Income Tax Law. The Income Tax Law only requires taxpayers to substantiate their purchases/expenses with proper purchase receipts - not necessarily EIS invoices. RRA may face legal disputes if they intend to implement CG announcements as law.,In our view, RRA should reinforce the importance of EIS invoices but allow a certain degree of flexibility when auditing taxpayers’ expenses. Whereas EIS invoices should be the , evidence a taxpayer should present as proof of purchase, RRA should be flexible enough to accept other forms of supporting documents if EIS invoices are not available, provided that RRA can validate that the cost was actually incurred and income declared by the other party. The possession of EIS invoices should not be an end in and of itself!",politics

Old friends and family outside Africa wondered why I would give up a comfortable life in Austin, Texas to move half-way across the world without a house or job to go to. And new friends and contacts here in Rwanda and East Africa wondered why I would choose to live in Kigali?,I heard many versions of the same joke: “You go to Nairobi to do business. You go to Kampala to party and have fun. And you come to Kigali to go to sleep.”,Yes, Kigali is certainly a lot more sedate than my former home cities of Hong Kong, London, Milan and New York but I have really enjoyed the relative peace, quiet, safety and lack of stress here over the last two years. My Kinyarwanda teacher Denyse tells me, “There is no need for “comfort food” here in Rwanda. All food is good and appreciated.”,After the first year of getting familiar with my new surroundings and learning the ropes, this last year of Corona-enforced solitude in my Kimihurura home has allowed me the cherished time to do a lot more self-refection, career/life prioritization and both professional and creative writing.,It has been very tough at times not hugging and having breakfast tacos with my grown daughter Emma in Texas and not being with close friends, particularly those who have been sick or suffering loss or heartache. But thanks to relatively reliable Wifi, WhatsApp and Zoom have afforded some level of virtual closeness with Emma and with many other friends, colleagues and even clients whom I would probably not have been in such close contact with otherwise.,I even did an animal communication course via Zoom, which came in handy when I inadvertently poisoned my Texan cat Coco last Summer and when one of my adopted street dogs Scout escaped recently. They are both fine now.,As more and more people get vaccinated – including me, hopefully – I know that this period of relative seclusion and tranquility is going to end for both good and maybe not so good.,On the positive side, there will be family reunions and social celebrations again. Some local friends here in Kigali will finally be able to get married properly and I will be able to visit my daughter in Texas in June. And renewed mobility will provide a much-needed remedy for growing “Zoom Fatigue”. One client at a large global foundation just told me that she had 57 web calls last week!,Unfortunately, there will also be pressure to get back into the “busyness” of a return to more “normal” working life, with a barrage of daily, consecutive work meetings, which will now be face-to-face as well as on Zoom; renewed commutes and longer days in the office; irascible bosses and staff gossip; and crowded airports and cramped airplanes.,Hopefully, we can all find a way to retain the good that has emerged during the last year of Covid challenges and restrictions and to avoid repeating old mistakes and unhealthy patterns of behaviour.,The “Three Ms” of Mindfulness, Meditation (or prayer) and Mentoring can help us all to keep up grounded, centered and on track, both personally and professionally. And regular exercise, balanced diet and enough sleep will help too.,And I will continue my search for definitive answers to the following questions about living in Kigali:,1.     Why does Kinyarwanda have 10 classes of nouns and at least nine ways of saying the number Six - ,?,2.     Why do people not use the beautifully groomed public parks for picnics or even just jogging or walking their dogs?,3.     Why do people pass you on the right in their cars in the road but on the left when walking on the pavement/sidewalk?,4.     Why do some taxis have steering wheels on the right and why do many taxi drivers not carry any change at all for a RWF 5,000 note?,5.     Why are there somewhat scary, tall, thin, white grimacing mannequins outside clothing stores?,6.     Why can you usually get dry wine in a restaurant but not always sweet wine?,7.     Why do Rwandans love cows and milk but not see protein-filled yoghurt as a healthy lunch or produce and consume different kinds of cheese (such as fresh Parmesan, which I will begin asking visitors to bring again)?",politics

","Training the future’s health workforce within rural, poor, or vulnerable settings is a sustainable means of addressing global health inequities. Students acquire an understanding and ability to analyse the unique bio-social health challenges faced by marginalized groups, and are therefore better positioned to provide tailored, contextualized care for those most vulnerable. ,Yet while this need evidently exists, too few future health professionals stay within low-resourced settings where the need is greatest, swept up instead in the, of students to train in cities where they will likely be better compensated, and have greater access to resources.,The problem of ‘,’ hangs on two issues: there are too few quality institutions within rural settings, and those that do exist, lack sufficient infrastructure and facilities to compete with the education offered in urban institutions. ,Lack of funding (both upfront and long-term investment) coupled with a lack of properly trained project managers in these areas has resulted in , in rural health institutions, which severely caps the learning opportunities these institutions can provide.,Without funding, many rural institutions will be unable to procure even the most basic equipment, laboratory and classroom space, and online learning capacity systems, the latter which has been critical to the survival of these organisations during Covid-19.,Beyond procurement, without qualified project managers you cannot implement them in a structured and phased way to ensure future sustainability. ,Whilst Covid-19 has resulted in large-scale investment towards healthcare and education infrastructure in urban areas such as,in central London and, in Boston Massachusetts, many rural healthcare and health education facilities including hospitals, health centres, health posts, and medical schools have been left behind.,This lack of funding stems from low tax or revenue base for raising domestic funds, low prioritisation of health in public sector resource allocation, spending inefficiencies, and the widespread misconception that quality medical and learning facilities can only exist and be properly implemented within urban settings.,Public and private institutions, governments and funding organizations need to recognize that by bolstering the institutional infrastructure in rural areas, they create robust foundations to,for all.,The University of Global Health Equity (,), a global health sciences university in the rural north of Rwanda, is proof of this. It’s students benefit from unparalleled learning opportunities within a state-of-the-art campus, whilst also in close proximity to the communities they will go on to serve.,UGHE’s well-equipped science laboratories facilitate anatomy dissection and basic and clinical sciences education, and a sophisticated campus simulation center offers students extensive practice with realistic patient care scenarios.,Classrooms are equipped with modern teleconferencing capabilities to facilitate remote instruction, such as the ability to host virtual anatomy lessons between two continents.,Infrastructure considerations should not stop at practical facilities, though of course these are critical. At UGHE, the strategic planning process extends to making its campus green and environmentally sound, in the knowledge that a conducive learning environment is an important part of student study.,The students and those that serve them - faculty, staff, and campus contractors - study and operate in a deliberately green space, surrounded by trees, butterfly gardens, fish ponds, and the 13.5ft Muhabura volcano in Rwanda’s Volcanoes National park. ,This same principle applies to health facilities such as hospitals and health centers: a green and, is conducive to the provision of high quality medical care and better patient and health worker mental wellbeing.,Across the valley from UGHE’s Campus, , was designed and built to provide high quality medical care and a patient-centered experience. Green energy and infection control features are also among the major guiding forces to its expansion plans that will see it accredited as a teaching hospital for Rwanda's public and private medical schools. ,With Covid-19 putting intense pressure on health care and education institutional systems,  health sectors and health education institutions should embrace , and adaptations to maintain vital services amidst a crisis and efficiently respond to the changing institutional requirements.,Adaptations include transitioning to virtual teaching, and revised campus operational policies and protocols to meet hygiene and social distancing measures. Agility is key to rapid response, supported by the collaboration, task shifting and clear communications between institutional staff who themselves can serve as,Health care and health educational institutional leaders will also need to determine the facilities maintenance approaches and systems that are pertinent to their institutional architecture, engineering and location to accommodate future growth.,UGHE’s Butaro Campus was uniquely built using locally sourced materials for building and a 90% local construction workforce, making maintenance easy, and simultaneously driving socio-economic impact in the surrounding communities.,A mobile-first facility management system, was also acquired to manage the University wide infrastructure. The system allows quick interaction among and between the campus maintenance team and all campus occupants irrespective of where they are.,The campus was also already designed to accommodate crises like Covid-19; private student and staff housing supports social distancing, and pre-existing learning management platforms facilitates virtual teaching. ,The ever-evolving Covid-19 measures warrant agile, adaptable systems and strong facilities management teams to maintain quality health and education services for all. The location of health care and health education facilities should not determine the quality of healthcare and health education facilities located in rural areas.,High quality medical care and education can be, and should be delivered in state-of-the-art facilities in rural areas, to ensure that the health professionals trained are qualified, responsive, and equitable in their approach to delivering care to the communities that need it most.",politics

For it was true: “COVAX was the only global solution to this pandemic.”,Its aim was to have two billion doses available initially so that, in case of rich countries going for bilateral deals and swallowing up vaccines like kids swallow up candy, there’d be enough for also low-income economies. 5% would be put aside for those under nobody’s care, like refugees.,After all, as far as Covid-19 is concerned, no one is safe until everyone is safe.,It made sense to all economies.,Until the first vaccines were approved and all hell broke loose!

This meant frontline healthcare workers, guidelines-enforcers, high-risk/vulnerable people and people in crowded places like prisons.,Prison one terrorist-suspect member of which is happy that he met a pastor who delivered him unto vaccine-nirvana land, where he escaped from waiting for eons. But that’s a by-the-way.,After the other said-vaccinated, followed those whose interactions, and in places where capacities, could be regulated: people in leadership of all areas, in markets, transport, construction, et al.,All of the above which are not what Rwanda boasts that The Firm can’t. Rather, it’s that being host to refugee camps, she did not leave out any of the refugees in that vaccination effort.,The small lesson: in the eyes of Powerful Mother Nature, we are all simple little earthlings that should live harmoniously together. And as such, either we swim together or we’ll sink together.,The great lesson: Covid-19 demonstrates that anybody in all of humanity can fail to breathe, knee on neck or none.,On a different note, let’s remember the passing-away of President John P.

https://www.newtimes.co.rw/opinions/everyone-should-choosetochallenge-gender-stereotypes-and-gender-bias,"Everyone should #ChooseToChallenge gender stereotypes and gender bias
","This year’s theme for International Women’s Day, “Choose to Challenge”, encourages everyone to call out gender bias and inequality, hailing the notion that from challenge comes change and that change leads to transformation. Even though it will take years to attain gender equality, it is everyone’s responsibility to challenge gender stereotypes and harmful social norms.,Being a girl, I can testify that these gender stereotypes are real and have affected me in one way or another. An example of a victim of gender stereotyping is a girl growing up with her self-esteem, ambition and expectations already curved to fit the society in which she is raised.,Her choices for her own sexual and reproductive health are based upon norms that regulate women’s freedom, particularly in regard to their sexual identity and life, resulting in restrictions on her sexual and reproductive rights. Her choice to reject bride price, for instance, should be respected and valued.,Another example of gender stereotype is an empowered woman who chooses to go to school, get her degrees, build her own house, but is questioned by society about whether she will ever find a man who will marry her.,Due to the perception that her achievements intimidate men and will put her at risk of not finding a man, they question whether she will end up alone for the rest of her life. However, if these successes were logged by her male counterpart, this man would be labelled as a strong and successful person.,He will still be praised by society even if he chooses not to marry and no one will be bothered if he ends up alone and dies without marrying.,Violence against women and girls is also rooted in the patriarchal power imbalance between men and women, and in the dominant belief that men protect, provide for and have authority over their family and that good women prioritize their family’s health and wellbeing. After marriage, women’s most important role is to serve their husbands and raise their children.,According to the United Nations, “a gender stereotype is a generalised view or preconception about attributes, or characteristics that are or ought to be possessed by women and men or the roles that are or should be performed by men and women. Gender stereotypes can be both positive and negative for example, ‘women are nurturing’ or ‘women are weak’”. Gender stereotyping is the act of placing these attributes on to a woman or man solely because of their membership in the social group of women or men.,The strongest forces behind gender gaps are harmful social norms and stereotypes which limit the expectations of what women and men can or should do. These barriers discriminate against women. They are deeply ingrained and all around us.,Confronting and changing stereotypes is therefore vital to evolving how both women and men are able to operate in a society. This responsibility touches each and every facet of people’s lives, from what they see and experience at home, to what they learn at school, and how they are treated at work or on the streets.,When challenging these stereotypes and biases, we should be confident and firm, because women’s rights are human rights. Change doesn’t happen overnight, but speaking up will bring about transformation.,If we all choose to speak up, and challenge harmful social norms and stereotypes, we may inspire people to find the courage to speak up for themselves, and slowly bring the change we want to see.,It is everyone’s obligation to reshape these stereotypes; this shared goal’s success will have an impact on us all. Gender transformative approaches should include people of all ages, all genders, professionals in all services, and leaders in all structures if our central goal is to bring about gender equality, non-violence and power sharing.,T",politics

","If there were any doubts about the necessity of digital transformation to business sustainability, the Covid-19 pandemic has silenced them.,Organisers of Miss Rwanda beauty pageant announced that this year’s contest will be streamed on YouTube, with viewers paying 3 USD (Rwf 3,000) to watch the finale, scheduled to take place on Saturday, March 20, 2021.,When it was revealed that this year’s context will have a digital component to it, the reactions were mixed, with many asking why not postpone the context until people are allowed to gather again.  The organisers disagreed and went ahead with their digital plans focusing on the positives and future.,By going digital, the contest will reach larger audiences, boost engagement, build community and grow their revenue and influence as well as exposure beyond Rwanda’s borders.,When the coronavirus spread across the globe, changes become instant. In Rwanda, shortly after the first case was reported, orders were issued to stay home, large gathering were banned, and in-person businesses were restricted.,One year down the road, some of the restrictions are still in place and so is the virus. As a result, schools, organisations and businesses figured out how to use technology to continue their operations, serve their customers and more importantly, remain in business.,Before the pandemic, talk of digitisation was rife among businesses and organisations. Some had already kicked-off implementation of their digital strategies and others had it within their priority plans. However, what covid-19 has done, is to expedite these plans. Companies have been forced to seek digital solutions and invest in digital to future-proof their businesses.,According to a survey conducted by McKinsey & Company, a New York-based management consulting firm, as of July 2020, globally about 55 percent of products and/or services are fully or partially digitized, compared to 35 percent in December 2019 and 28 percent in May 2018, both before the pandemic.  ,The survey titled “How Cocvid-19 Has Pushed Companies Over The Technology Tipping Point—And Transformed Business Forever.” was conducted on-line from July 7 to July 31, 2020.,Twilio, an American cloud communications platform also surveyed more than 2,500 company decision makers about digital transformation and the results indicated that digital transformation had been accelerated by up to six years within their organisations.,According to the study, 97% of executives said the pandemic sped up their digital transformation, 95% said they’re looking for new ways to engage customers and 79% said Covid-19 propelled them to increase budgets for digital transformation.,While many may have scoffed at the Miss Rwanda contest for going digital, many more will acknowledge that the adoption of digital strategies opens a new world of opportunities, irrespective of the field you operate in. And, the pandemic has only served to remind the laggards that, with very rare exception, operating digitally is the only way to stay competitive in this new business and economic environment.",politics
https://www.newtimes.co.rw/opinions/celebrating-revamped-kigali-car-free-zone-imbuga-city-walk,"Celebrating a revamped Kigali car free zone (Imbuga City Walk)
","This week, we woke up to big news that the long awaited ‘Imbuga City Walk’ project on Kigali’s car free zone, as we know it, has come to fruition. The street will be transformed into ‘a recreational and green space’, whose implementation is on the move and expected to be complete within three months.,The news further detailed the project components as: pedestrian and cycling friendly pavements; green corridor landscaping; kiosks for food court and other items; exhibition zone; and kids’ playground. Several support facilities will also be in place such as; street benches and free WiFi; city lounge and arcade; pedestrian-friendly street lamps and public toilets. What more can we ask?,On 15th September 2015, I started making opinion column contributions in this newspaper, having been inspired by the then active debate on the events and aspirations on the car free zone.,I recall celebrating the move the City of Kigali had made in setting precedent on the war against the ‘asphalt and concrete jungle’ that has been attacking cities from all ends in this era of rapid urbanization.,At the time, I was only beginning my doctoral studies, on the topic of public space, disturbed by the fact that many cities especially in the global south have shown only marginal expansions in their public open space, despite the overwhelming expansion of the built environment.,Kigali’s intention to host her first ever car free zone at that point in time was indeed a terrific inspiration, as it served as a living testimony that cities can, after all, pay attention to their quality of urban life in unique ways, opening up possibilities in which streets could become successful social spaces.,Many other streets in Kigali remain ubiquitous with car use and hence why the idea of a car free zone, with pedestrians deserving a higher priority that vehicles that have growingly dominated the space, becomes an exciting one.,Over the last five years, we have had several pieces written on the topic of Kigali’s car free zone, published in this paper or elsewhere, and most of them have been sharing the concern that the street remained dead over a longer period of time, than expected.,The opinions, based on the optimism of the zone, have been good and healthy, as they kept a constant reminder to the city urban planners to fast track the process but we may not be having a lot of pace now to complain and rant about the absence of life and vibrancy on the street. The city has finally moved forward to nail it and basically we have been given three months, while the city completes the project, to start planning our activities on the Imbuga City Walk, obviously in respect to existing health protocols.,Considering that for the last 12 months we have largely been spending time in our homes or neighbourhoods, with travel restrictions in place and calls for social distancing as a way to prevent the spread of the Covid-19 virus, this news is both timely and relevant to us all. ,But just what will make the Imbuga city walk work?,The first conversation is around the concern of empty street. To ensure that the street does not remain ‘dead’ as we have critiqued it to have been, it will need people and activities. You and I will need to make intentional decisions to show up and be present there.,Obviously before the new design that is being implemented now, it was still difficult for the street to attract people and activities. There was not so much to do there, the zone, although absent of vehicles, was still not comfortable as it was without basic support facilities and amenities.,Now that there is a purposeful design in place, that is aiming to transform the zone into recreational and green space, one would expect that the addition of support facilities, improved accessibility, better linkages, safety and comfort, would make it substantially attractive leading to a more active and vibrant public space.,The second is around the businesses along the street. There has been concerns shared on the survival of businesses along the street, whose presence is of paramount important to the survival of the Imbuga city walk, but whose survival ought to be also supported by the public space.,This dialectic relationship is important since the street business will be affected by the street design changes. Hopefully, the case of a participatory design process, in which the business owners were involved in the conversations during both the design and implementation of the car free zone is expected to introduce business-friendly design elements that support both the social life as well as the economic life of the street.,Obviously business serve customers on their feet, not in their cars and hence the project increment in users of the Imbuga City Walk may as well bring in more customers to the adjacent businesses. The business on this zone have also been offered working service lanes parallel to the KN4 street and if they have survived the last 5 years of an empty street, they can only expect to do much better now.,The third is around equitable access. It is expected that the city walk will attract many more people than it has been doing in the last five years. Visitors will be drawn from the different economic levels and so a consideration in ensuring efficient bus transit from the various neighbourhoods in Kigali and other bus terminus, with efficient bus stops on either sides of the zone, would be very useful to the many visitors, especially the low-income citizen who rely on buses.,Bicycle lanes are already incorporated in the zone and this is expected to boost the already arising trend in cycling in Kigali.,The newly designed public space will be a container of multiple human activities, making it better capable of catering for our functional, social, and recreational needs in a more successful manner. This way, the Imbuga City Walk is expected to increasingly and positively associate with economic growth, better physical health of people and a stronger sense of community.",politics
https://www.newtimes.co.rw/opinions/why-china-decided-improve-hong-kongs-electoral-system,"Why China decided to improve Hong Kong’s electoral system
","The 4th session of the 13th National People’s Congress (NPC) of China held recently made a decision to improve Hong Kong’s electoral system, aiming at a new electoral system that suits Hong Kong’s realities.,This is an important move to uphold the “one country, two systems” policy, to implement the principle of “patriots governing Hong Kong”, and to maintain the long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong. Let me share with you the following views.,First, it is imperative that China improves Hong Kong’s electoral system. Since Hong Kong returned to China as a Special Administrative Region (SAR) in 1997, the Chinese Central Government has all along fully and faithfully implemented the policies of ""one country, two systems"", ""Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong"" and a high degree of autonomy.,We have run Hong Kong affairs in accordance with the law, upheld the constitutional order in Hong Kong as established by the Constitution of China and the Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR, supported the development of democracy in Hong Kong, with achievements recognized by international communities.,However, in recent years, anti-China, destabilizing forces and radical localists in Hong Kong have openly clamoured for ""Hong Kong independence"". Taking advantage of loopholes in current electoral system, they entered various government and legislative institutions via election, blatantly carried out activities to paralyze the functioning of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong and obstruct the law-based governance of the SAR Government.,Some even tried to challenge the authority of the Chinese Central Government and seize jurisdiction over the SAR. The rioting and turbulence occurred in the Hong Kong society reveals that the existing electoral system in Hong Kong has clear loopholes and deficiencies. We feel obliged to take measures to improve the system and remove the risks.,Second, it is legitimate that China improves Hong Kong’s electoral system. Hong Kong is one of China’s local administrative regions, Hong Kong’s electoral system is in nature part of China’s local electoral system. How to develop and improve Hong Kong’s electoral system is purely China's internal affair, which foreign countries have no right to interfere in. Just as laws and rules concerning local elections in Rwanda need to be decided by the Parliament, China’s top legislature, the NPC has the right to decide on Hong Kong’s electoral system. This decision fully accords with China’s constitution, the Basic Law of Hong Kong, as well as worldwide common practices, and holds indisputable legitimacy.,Some western countries try to find fault with the “patriots governing Hong Kong” principle, but neglect their own requirements that their citizens or people in public office need to pledge loyalty to their country. It is more than reasonable that Hong Kong, as a Chinese SAR, shall be governed by people who love their country.,Third, it is favourable to Hong Kong itself if its electoral system gets improved. Democracy had been almost absent from Hong Kong’s 150-plus years of colonial rule, and has only been established and promoted since its return to China. China will not simply copy other country’s electoral system when improving Hong Kong’s, will instead proceed based on Hong Kong’s realities. The new system will reflect the interests of society, ensure extensive and balanced political participation, so as to promote social cohesion in Hong Kong. All in all, to improve the electoral system is to ensure a healthier and better development of Hong Kong’s democracy under the “one country, two systems” policy.,China and Rwanda share the same notion that the development path of a country shall only be chosen by itself and its people. We both adhere to the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, including respect the sovereignty of states, and non-intervention in the internal affairs of any state.,Rwanda always expresses its support for China in implementing the ""one country, two systems"" policy, its opposition against foreign interference in China’s political and socio-economic issues, and its belief in China’s ability to manage its internal affairs.,This fully highlights the deep friendship between the two countries, and we applaud and appreciate Rwanda’s solidarity with us. China will remain committed to Hong Kong's long-term prosperity and stability. Hong Kong’s future will be brighter!,.",politics

The daily updates of the Health Ministry also point to dropping infection rates and rising recoveries.,The country was also found ready to host the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting scheduled for the 21st of June this year. The readiness is despite all the social economic problems the country and the world has had to deal with over the past year. The Commonwealth secretary general, on her three day visit in the country, said that the readiness was not only evident in the sites ready but also in the nation’s eagerness to receive guests without jeopardizing safety of both citizens and visitors.,This week, the eagerly awaited cabinet decisions brought a sigh of relief to many, as Covid-19 restrictions were eased further, including longer working hours and easier countrywide movement, breathing the much-needed oxygen into the national economy. ,The developments can be termed as a positive tide to make the most of.  A positive tide in that it’s an opportunity for the country to complete preparations ahead of the oncoming summit with less than 100 days to go as well as further allow resumption of economic activity to ensure previous years’ progress is not undone in the process.,The progress is not without its set of challenges which include ensuring that the country does not fall back in aspects such as letting our guard down with regard to the pandemic that is within our midst.,Even with the continued vaccination process, preventive measures still stand.

","Somalia remains on course to join the East African Community, hopefully in the not too distant future. The Summit of EAC Heads of State , to follow up on the verification process for the country’s admission speaks as much.,Somalia’s application to join the Community has remained pending since 2012. A likely hitch explaining the delay is the country’s persistent. Its admission might however even take longer if it continues to be mired in election wrangles, which threaten , that bedevils the country.,There is little doubt the issues surrounding the missed deadline to hold the presidential elections last month can be overcome. But the collapse of talks yet again early this month to end the impasse show how fraught the situation is.,Among conditions a prospective state must meet to join the Community include adherence to good governance and democracy, and wherewithal to strengthen integration.,These conditions presuppose political stability, which in turn engenders consensus in decision-making in ensuring a country’s social and economic development.,A potential EAC member has to have these to integrate and effectively participate in the bloc.,This means Somalia has to urgently put its house in order. One of the contentious issues in the current wrangles is whether or not the constitution mandates that President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed (Farmajo) should have stepped down after his term expired on 8 February.,He believes the law allows him to stay in office until a new vote is held. The opposition is adamant he should not be in office after his term’s expiration. They accuse him of attempting to monopolise power and manipulating the electoral process to favour him.,However, the major areas of dispute that have stymied implementation of the September 2020 electoral agreement include the composition of federal and state-level electoral bodies that will oversee the polls.,Parties can also not agree over who should manage the vote for delegates originally from the self-declared republic of Somaliland. They are also at odds over how to conduct the election in Gedo, where the federal government and Jubaland administration have been locked in a year-long standoff.,At its core, the longstanding discord relates to unresolved questions overpower and resource sharing between the Federal government and the member states.,Political wrangles have also hurt cooperation on issues that require the central and regional governments to work together, such as security arrangements and completion of a provisional constitution.,The , suggests that, given the degree of distrust among Somalia’s elites, third-party mediation is urgently needed.,The UN and African Union (AU), backed by other international actors with influence in Somalia, such as the US, the European Union, the UK, Turkey, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, should step in now to broker a deal over how to manage the election and break a stalemate that could well push Somalia back into clan-based violence if it persists.,Reconciliation, particularly between the federal government and member states, should be a priority. Quick progress on all fronts is important, as by 2023 a new cycle of state elections will kick off carrying on toward the next federal election in 2024.,Given the difficult issues, it’s not simplistic to say there’s no reason the protagonists shouldn’t appreciate why Somalia is bigger than any one faction or member of the elite.,Reconciliation should be possible. Then holding the delayed elections will live up to the billing that they will be a ,.,While Al Shabaab extremists remain a problem, Somalia’s admission into the Common Market of Eastern and Southern Africa in 2018 shows how it might fit within the EAC, some of whose member states are part of the supraregional bloc that brings together 21 countries.,Membership in IGAD, despite ,, can also only help in integrating the country.,And, with the prospect of the Democratic Republic of Congo joining the East African Community with the promise to vastly enlarge the market it is another good reason to welcome Somalia to the party.",politics
https://www.newtimes.co.rw/opinions/value-added-tax-implications-intra-group-services-rwanda,"Value Added Tax implications on intra-group services in Rwanda
","For many groups of companies or multinationals, intra-group services, which are services provided by one or more entities within a group to other companies in the group, or for the benefit of the group as a whole, can be the kind of thing that cannot be just avoided.,Like attending the wedding celebrations of a cousin whom you hardly ever see and don’t actually like very much, it is your duty as a good family member to make that effort.,Some intra-group services such as management services, central purchasing, human resource and finance services can be directly provided by the parent company or one of the group company to other group companies (for want of a better term, I shall refer to these services as direct services) whereas other services like legal, tax, IT and marketing can be contracted-out or bought-in by one group company to the benefit of other group entities with the costs for such services being reallocated and recharged to other group companies using sensible allocation keys such as headcount and turnover. Sometimes a mark-up is added on the costs recharged.,Income tax (or at least transfer pricing) implications of intra-group services have attracted much attention, but VAT implications of such services can be sometime overlooked, hence the consideration of such subject by this article.,Consideration of VAT implications of intra-group services in Rwanda requires a look at the relevant provisions of law n° 37/2012 of 09/11/2012 establishing the value added tax (the “VAT Law”). In terms of article 3 of the VAT Law, value added tax is charged on taxable goods and services; and taxable imported goods and services.,Taxable goods and services are under article 2 of the same law defined as taxable goods or service supplied to a person, and this suggests that VAT must be charged, applying the relevant rate, on each supply of goods or services unless such goods or services are VAT exempt.,These provisions of the VAT Law can work easily with direct services, and unless such services are VAT exempt, VAT must be charged at the relevant rate whenever the supply of such services is made.,In case such intra-group services are supplied to the Rwandan group company by a foreign group company (imported services), VAT will be declared and paid by the Rwandan group company recipient of such services using the VAT reverse charge mechanism in accordance with article 12 of the VAT Law, and if such or similar services could be obtained on the Rwandan market, the VAT paid will not be allowed as deductible or refundable input VAT.,Conversely, the application of the above provisions to the contracted-out or bought-in services especially when the costs for these services are recharged to the group companies recipient thereof without a mark-up being added by the group entity that procured such services may not be an easy task.,This is largely owing to the fact apart from being procured by and invoiced to the relevant group entity, these services (e.g. training and employee development; and developing and monitoring of staff health procedures) are in some instances directly provided to the group entities recipient of the services by a third party original supplier.,That then gives rise to the question as to whether there is a supply of service by the relevant group company for the purpose of VAT, which this article answers in the affirmative in that the costs recharged by the relevant group entity at least cover the cost to such group entity of making the services available to other group entities recipient of the services, with all the value added tax implications alluded to in relation to direct services coming into play.,In any case, no VAT would apply if the cost recharged by the group entity is a disbursement in the sense that the relevant group entity had paid an invoice issued by a third party to one of the group companies and was recouping the cost from such group company. ,The above indicates that the issue of application of VAT on intra-group services is rarely that simple, and Rwandan companies supplying and/or making payment for intra-group services (as the case may be) should seek tax advice to ascertain whether or not service charges or recharges they receive from and/or pay to their parent companies or other group entities represent consideration for vatable supplies.",politics

called out
","Observers of Rwanda’s politics are noticing dangerous patterns where an individual engages in criminality, claims political persecution, and then joins or forms a political organisation “to challenge” the government.,The problem with this path is that the moment politics becomes the arena for criminals, those who have genuine political ambitions to contribute to the society will shun politics.,In most societies, the best among them aspire for political leadership and are encouraged to do so because they can bring positive change. However, some foreigners want a different arrangement for Rwanda: they want to propagate the worst amongst us, convicted criminals and fugitives, to be the ones offering themselves to reconcile or to lead Rwandans even when the law is clear that a convicted felon cannot serve at any level of leadership.,Criminal charges or a conviction - and the notoriety that comes with it, seem to have become the surest way for one to either join a political party or to form one. However, because criminals don’t trust each other, they are more likely to form a new party than join an existing one.,This is the first sign that they don’t join politics for the right reasons: which would have been to serve the people. Obviously, no criminal - self-centred by definition - sees service to others as an important aspiration for their lives. It is their anti-social behaviors such as greed that drive them into criminality in the first place.,The political fugitives of the RNC are a case in point. Rusesabagina has equally been on the run until the law caught up to him. Ingabire Victoire sought to conceal her criminality behind politics. Many more are likely to surface because they enjoy the context of foreign interference that encourages and supports their criminal behavior in the name of politics.,Consequently, they join politics because they have an axe to grind, or see it as an easy pathway to self-aggrandizement. For one thing, like almost all criminals, they don’t accept that they did anything wrong – even when a mountain of evidence is looking them in the eye. The common joke here in town is that all criminals at the former 1930 Prison always said that they were innocent, even genocide perpetrators who every member of their community saw killing people in 1994. They say everyone is lying; they are innocent. They, too, have an axe to grind.,Most criminals choose to join politics because they failed to challenge the evidence that was used to convict them. Having been exposed by the justice system, they look to “challenge” the political system that didn’t interfere to stop the judges from sentencing them.,In the quest for this vengeance, they dedicate the rest of their lives to political manipulation and self-mythologization because they don’t think they will be able to stay away from criminality. Politics and unquestioning support from foreigners becomes a way of shielding themselves from the consequences of their certain recidivism.,Moreover, having destroyed their own reputations through their criminal behaviour, they try to manipulate others into helping them dilute and eliminate responsibility. The same way the leaders of the Genocide in 1994 told people that “if we all kill they won’t hold anyone accountable.”,It’s a cunning way to avoid the long arm of the law. If recidivism kicks in and they are held accountable for their felonies, they claim it is political persecution; it is the system being intolerant of dissent.,Like a mafia organization that uses a night club or a casino as a front for laundering illicit funds, criminals-cum-politicians create political parties to try to cover up their criminal reputations and reinvent themselves.,It is a diversion. A tool they use to fool people into joining them under the false belief that they have an agenda beyond petty vengeance and shielding themselves from the consequences of guaranteed future criminality.,It is short-sighted, however. Rwanda is a country of laws. Even though some continue to push the line and to regularly flirt with criminality, they know the red line beyond which they are guaranteed to fall foul of the law.,Finally, it is bizarre how these convicted criminals attract foreign support and sympathy in what has become a bizarre political charade. Often, it is the foreign elements that attract them with promises of funding and legitimacy to “challenge” the current government. If these busybodies were genuine in wanting to support politicians who would “challenge” the government in order to promote “competitive” politics, they would have plenty of law-abiding Rwandans to choose from.,There are limits to the cover pseudo politics offers from criminal liability. The kind of “democracy” they want for Rwanda with criminals as political leaders is dangerous for any country and for Rwanda in particular.

The list, which was progressively improved and it ended up with 1,146 fugitives scattered in at least 33 countries on different continents.,The team contacted all the host countries and handed them the indictments with an option of arresting these mass murders and either extradite them to Rwanda for trial or domestically try them.,Fast-forward to 2021, only 46 of these fugitives have been arrested and processed through courts, as announced last week by the head GFTU during a training of parliamentarians on the convention on Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.,This means that 1,100 indicted fugitives are still at large. Besides these, there are others who were tried and convicted in absentia by Rwandan courts, especially the semi-traditional courts, Gacaca, who have never been found to serve their sentences.,Among the reasons why the small number of arrests as stated by prosecutors is the use of political cover by these fugitives to continue evading justice. They claim to be in opposition politics and therefore an attempt to bring them to book is seen as an attack on political opponents.,Some of those countries are in cahoots with the fugitives for different reasons and are covering for them to ensure they remain out of reach of the long arm of justice.,It is a travesty of justice that countries allow these mass murders to use politics to evade accountability for the crimes they committed in Rwanda. It is even more disturbing that majority of these fugitives are in Africa, more so within the Great Lakes Region.,It is imperative that these countries play their role as prescribed under the UN Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide to bring the fugitives to book.,Much as the crime of Genocide is imprescriptible in nature and therefore not bound by the statute of limitation, the time is running out and therefore they are growing old and may therefore not live long enough to have their day in court.",politics

Rwanda-Arsenal deal?
","Last week Barney Ronay published an article in The Guardian UK with the title “, He was referring to Rwanda’s sponsorship deal with Arsenal Football Club where the latter promotes the “Visit Rwanda” brand. This is indeed a worthy question for debate. Unfortunately, Mr. Ronay does not address it with reason. As a result, he allows hostility towards the Rwandan government to lead the way in his framing of the debate and ends up misleading.,He gets out of the gates with a bizarre formulation that “the situation there [in Rwanda]” is of “international concern”. By this, he refers to unsubstantiated allegations of “deaths in custody, enforced disappearances and torture raised by the UK government that, in his view, should compel Arsenal to rescind this mutually beneficial partnership with Rwanda.,These allegations were dead on arrival when their main source that the UK government relied on was Human Rights Watch (HRW). Rwanda has been the cemetery of HRW’s reputation through a series of blunders that were documented by former U.S. official, Richard Johnson, who demonstrated that HRW has an axe to grind against the Rwandan government and that its advocacy on Rwanda is “,”.  ,Scholars like Phil Clark have questioned the organisation for its , that has persistently opposed the transfers and extraditions of genocide suspects to face justice in Rwanda, to say the least about dubious reports where ,. But it’s not just Rwanda that has buried the phony organisation whose reputation has sunken after a series of blunders, including ,.,In other words, this is not an organisation whose work any serious entity would reference as a basis for taking decisions that affect mutually beneficial relations. On the contrary, it warrants a decision on the part of Arsenal FC to reinforce its partnership with Rwanda by not only committing to “raising awareness of the country as a luxury holiday destination” but, more importantly, to actively challenge those, like Ronay, that wish to sabotage Rwanda’s incredible story of “culture, heritage and transition.” This would demonstrate the kind of moral clarity that eludes Ronay and Human Rights Watch.,Maybe with time Arsenal would bring some clarity to Ronay. First, no reasonable person still believes, for instance, that Paul Rusesabagina was “bundled on to a plane in Dubai to face what his family has called a sham trial on terrorism charges” as Ronay continues to insist despite evidence that includes , that even Rusesabagina could not challenge when given the opportunity to do so during his court hearing last week proving that the terror suspect found himself in Rwanda on his own volition without any iota of coercion.,As a result of these proceedings, no reasonable person still believes that Rwanda had no legitimate grounds to bring the terror suspect before the courts despite what until that time were distractions pushed by the mainstream media that attempted to render insignificant ,. Ronay suggests that by partnering with Rwanda Arsenal risks damaging its reputation when in fact it is The Guardian whose standing as a credible newspaper is damaged by rehashing his discredited views. This is despite , whose well-intentioned commentary is a cautionary tale for The Guardian in its quest to preserve its reputation.,On its part, The New York Times has salvaged its reputation with the publication of , on the Hollywood “hero” turned terrorist leader. In light of the evidence against Rusesabagina, the focus should shift to transnational terrorism and how to enhance cooperation to fight it. Freedom House’s distorted advocacy, which Ronay regurgitates uncritically, attempts to frame the fight against terrorism as “transnational repression.” Rather than advocate for the apprehension of terrorists wherever they may be, this thinking is a shot in the arm of terror groups; it blurs the line between legitimate and legal actions by the Rwanda government and dubious allegations of human rights violations. The war global war on terror, if it really also includes the protection of African lives, could use more clarity and less confusion.,The sooner the better for this kind of clarity for everyone involved. That’s because as more evidence is uncovered in Rusesabagina’s case, questions will arise as to why this man was not arrested sooner, in Europe or America, despite an international arrest warrant issued by Rwanda.,This indifference will shed further light on the question of why other terrorist groups that are hell-bent on overthrowing the government of Rwanda through violent armed struggle, including remnants of genocidal forces, continue to find safe haven mainly in Europe, as Honourable Andrew Mitchell has underscored regarding the obligation of the United Kingdom, for example. If everyone took their responsibility seriously, it would bring an end to the status quo of indifference to criminality, by those who purport to believe in the rule of law, and ensure that these criminal groups that have evaded accountability since are brought to book. After all, these are what the commonwealth values are about: to bring suspects to court, any court, even when others summarily execute them.,As a member of the commonwealth, it’s important that Rwanda’s culture and heritage constitute these shared values. In this regard, Arsenal is a pioneer in bringing Rwanda to the British people and helping to indirectly challenge negative perceptions about the Rwandan people. Three years after the deal, contemptuous arguments that question Rwanda’s investment on grounds of its low-income and aid recipient status have lost track and Ronay should know this much since he recognizes “that the campaign has been a success, lifting overall tourism numbers by 8%” and that “Rwanda has a functioning tourist industry”. The debate should now shift to how to continue this partnership in the midst of a pandemic that has affected the tourism industry worldwide and in terms beneficial to both partners. But such debate cannot take place in the toxic environment created by the likes of Ronay and facilitated by The Guardian.",politics

","Today, as the world struggles to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic, the integrity of information and public messaging can be a case of life or death. Yet, we see on a daily basis content that questions vaccines or the reality of the corona virus itself.,Ultimately, this creates doubt and undermines efforts to deal with what is a global crisis. Many of us will have experienced misinformation leaking into our networks through family or friends, intending to create enough doubt and confusion to pull people from the trust they had in their institutions.,Misinformation is false information intended for unsuspecting or unsophisticated recipients. In some cases, the motive behind misinformation lies in advertising revenue, but worryingly, in the majority of others, the motivation is ideological, destructive and shrouded in elaborate conspiracy theories. Many people contribute to the spread of this misinformation unaware that it is a tool used to create disruptive noise that destroys objective truth.,A 2018 study by three scholars at MIT found that ,. In political discourse, the occurrence of misinformation, which was once seen as a political anomaly in the West, has now become a regular occurrence for many of us online.,The growth of our social media platforms has hugely contributed to the spread of online misinformation. Our platforms have provided a supportive environment for manipulators to share fake news and false information while reaping the benefits under the deep cover of the internet. Social media is its vehicle, as many of us look to our platforms to present us with news stories from an array of sources.,Admittedly, being able to receive instant information directly from ,, ,, or , is appealing for those who wish to stay informed, but these platforms have been rightfully criticized for enabling the spread of misinformation with little in the form of checks and balances.,Traditionally, print media cultivated a reputation with their readers, which relied on fact checking information before it was published. Today, our social media news is presented to us regardless of quality and reliability; there is no filtering system, neither are there editors acting as gatekeepers to ascertain the validity of information.,Clearly, the social media machine was never built to reliably inform its audiences but to keep the user engaged through an endless supply of content. In fact, information overload has brought us to a point where misinformation seeps into our knowledge sharing and becomes difficult for many to differentiate between the truth and outright deliberate manipulation.,Fake news that we hear so often these days has become more than shock headlines that simply bring in clicks and advertising revenue; it has become politically driven to influence self-detrimental behaviour.,The 2016 US election was a catalyst for the exponential growth of modern misinformation campaigns. A , found that fake news played a significant role in depressing Hillary Clinton’s support, which led to Donald Trump’s victory, notwithstanding the result of the popular vote. The attack was attributed to enemies of the state, as experts in producing fake content and foreign agents combined to target the most vulnerable groups with false information. Social media users over the age of 65 proved to be particularly susceptible to misinformation, , as the younger age groups. It proved to be a lesson in how powerful political misinformation can be, and subsequently the New York Times reports that at least ,.,Covid-19 will not be overcome without the investment of every citizen, and that is what makes the existence of misinformation against the pandemic even more dangerous. When we engage content that questions vaccines or the pandemic, these are directed efforts to create doubt against what should be an objective global health crisis. Our cyber security services need to figure out the origins of the misinformation we encounter and deal with it, but there is plenty we can do at an individual level to ensure we do not spread misinformation any further. In my view, three things need to be done.,First, we need to be clear that we understand how misinformation works. Just as vaccines introduce small doses of a harmful substance to learn how to defend it, it is beneficial to identify what misinformation and fake news look like so that they can be avoided.,Misinformation tends to come from unclear sources both in authors and references, so it is best to be extremely critical over dubious authors and other origins of information.,Before sharing the content compare it with previous examples of misinformation and employ critical thinking to study its validity.  ,Second, it is essential that we confront misinformation firmly within our social media groups.,With the vast amount of content we share daily, there is plenty of misinformation present from some of our family and friends who are unaware of its dangers.  It is imperative to hastily denounce it and to educate those who share misinformation unknowingly on the detrimental effect it can have.,Finally, we all need to think twice before sharing anything and examine the knock-on effect of what sharing one piece of information can have on the mindset of another person. ,Even the smallest pieces of information can have a huge influence on behaviour, especially as the spread of misinformation relies on the closeness of networks to add extra validation towards false information. ,It is also useful to ask yourself whether you know enough about a subject to endorse its worth before a share or a retweet. ,As we aim to continue preserving our development, it is imperative that we provide real value to our information. Defeating the pandemic is reliant on defeating the info-demic, and there is much we can do to stop its spread before things get out of control. Protecting the integrity of our information is a critical investment in securing our development as a knowledge-led society.",politics

","Me, I’ve had it up to here! Everywhere I look or only point my head, this name assaults my feelings of decency and joie de vivre. The name Rusesabagina seems to be all over; on air, on screen, on paper, online, on-everything.,The energy expended on this man – expect my mouth never to utter this name again! – by all these good people and the not-so-good is more than he has used all his cooking life.,And his cooking life has been looong. Cooking all the way from the kitchens of Rwanda through to the kitchen of the then-prestigious Kenya Utalii College, from where he came as a chef.,After that, now he started the figurative cooking that saw him become manager of Hôtel Diplomate and, much later, nurse feelings of transforming into president of this country.,Roller-coasting to the top of this land, my foot!,But first things first. In 1994 as the then-government was fleeing, sowing death in its flight and leaving a trail of blood in its wake, he was going to wade through that blood to Gitarama, too, when the cooking bug tickled him. He went to Hôtel des Mille Collines for some looted fuel.,On finding the hotel abandoned by its owners, he saw the chance of a true cooking bonanza.,What’s out there is that he amassed bags of banknotes and promissory notes from the miserable victims escaping from the Genocide against the Tutsi before admission into Hôtel des Mille Collines, except a few close family friends.,That he kept the only international fax line for his cooking designs, denying the victims opportunity for a vital SOS call. That he kept the extremist RTLM radio updated with all victims under his ill-intentioned watch. That he cut water to many who resorted to chlorinated swimming-pool water.,All these and more greed-fed and hate-filled betrayals of his compatriots are well recounted by Edouard Kayihura who was the ‘inmate’ of the hotel and dared take time to see what was going on in all parts of the hotel as well as its environs. They are also documented in detail by Alfred Ndahiro and Privat Rutazibwa, from their research.,We’ll not go into how, later again, having landed an invitation and a decoration at the White House via so-called heroism cooked in Hollywood, he’d had his ego blown-up to bursting. Hubris which filled his head with visions of himself with the power to lord it over us.,He had the dollar-loot from a cooked-up charity organisation and speaking engagements, so what couldn’t he do? He organised to clinch the seat at the helm the way he only knew how; through violence. But that’s sub judice; the alleged terror attacks are shut from our public mention.,Suffice it to say the word “alleged” alone drills a hole into every heart of an orphan, a widow, nay, of every peace-loving Rwandan.,That aside, because his detailed behaviour in the hotel is from Rwandans who were there or dug up the details, no Western self-appointed expert on Rwanda would wish to throw a glance at them. They do not reflect the alternative “reality” of their liking.,They’ll never consider this government’s will to overlook all the barbarities of the time in the spirit of building a united Rwanda, either.,Nor will they want to hear the details of a man from their land who sets out to be faithful to his subject. Theirs is to jump on the chance of glorifying “their hero”, as per Hollywood, and use him as a springboard to vilify the person of President Kagame for his independent character.,Mr. Joshua Hammer and others of his respectable kind who give a faithful portrayal of the Rwandan situation are anathema to them.,Hammer has written such captivatingly detailed analysis, as a man who has been on the scene a number of times, that the rest of the cacophonous crowd must be crying in shame – if shame can feel another shame!,Honest Hammer, please do not quote this lounge (group) of lizard scavengers in the name of objectivity or balance. Personally, mention of any of their names turns my guts.,Because quoting the true hero of Rwanda’s recovery and rise in the same breath as a man suspected of sponsoring terror and his retinue of insult-hurlers has an underlying sense of moral equivalence.,Yet the rap that these Snows, Wrongs, Kurts, Thomsons, Péans, Birrels, Ronnays, the whole murky catalogue, have been copying and pasting from one another since 1994 is the same.,“Disappearances”, “murder”, “mysterious deaths”, “tyranny”, “threats”, “intimidation”, “imprisonment”, on and on, all put at the doorstep of Kagame.,Tell me, if any semblance of truth were to be associated with 26 years of this ugliness, wouldn’t these 12 million souls happily breathing this Rwandan fresh air have met their maker long ago?,The terror-sponsor suspect of their adoration must be laughing at them in his heart, seeing how he was among the first to get the Covid-19 vaccine.,In Belgium or USA that he so craves, his name would be somewhere near the bottom of the line!",politics

","I cannot believe that a year has gone by and we are still in this pandemic. To be honest, when I heard about the SARS - COV2 for the first time early last year, I did not think that it would get this worse.,Maybe I was too optimistic or biased because I had learned about and watched a few respiratory epidemics unfold (the SARS, MERS and swine flu unfold in the years 2000s and 2010s). It felt or sounded like it was far away, on another continent for a second.,However, I immediately realized that it was not. Most of all, I did not want to panic. I wanted to be prepared instead.,The question became how I could prepare for the unknown. Then my emotion network processing was activated and it has been like that since then. If you are feeling like me, you are not alone.,This past year has been a roller-coaster of emotions and feelings. We have questioned most of the things we do and why we do them. We all by now know someone who suffered from Covid-19. We have lost a friend or a relative to this pandemic.,Every aspect of our lives has been impacted by this pandemic. To make it worse, we have become great consumers of too much information from trusted and untrusted sources. After a year in this dizzying pandemic, understandably our feelings are high. As much as I wish this pandemic could be over tomorrow, it is likely that we still have some time with this SARS-CoV2 virus.,Why do I think so? There is no cure yet. However, if we continue to wash our hands, refrain from touching our faces, wear masks properly covering both our mouths and noses (I still see some people wear their masks on their chins or mouths and not covering their noses), respect physical (not social) distancing, and get vaccinated we will keep the infection rate down.,I also know that by now, everyone has heard about the vaccines and we all hope that this is a major step towards the end of this pandemic. I also know that there is much being said out there about these new vaccines. This does not help if one wants to make their decision on whether to accept or decline to take these vaccines. Let us look at it from a scientific point of view backed with evidence.  ,There are several vaccines against Covid-19 at different stages of development currently. If you are wondering why that many vaccines? Many doses are needed to get as many people as possible vaccinated around the world.,So far, about 300 million people have been vaccinated. Many of them are in 10 countries. About seven vaccines have been approved for emergency use worldwide. Some of these vaccines such as Moderna, Pfizer, and CureVac vaccines are messenger Ribonucleic Acid (mRNA), two shots in the muscle of the upper arm, 21 and 28 days apart respectively.,I have read some comments from people who are concerned by the fact that some of these vaccines are mRNA vaccines, thus, may be wondering if they should go ahead and take them or not. What does that really mean?,mRNA vaccines are a new type of vaccine to protect against infectious diseases. I should mention that until last year, the way vaccines were made had not changed that much for more than two centuries.,Many vaccines put a weakened or inactivated virus or bacteria in our body to trigger an immune response. Not mRNA vaccines, thanks to the advancements in science and technology of the 21st century. mRNA vaccines, give instructions (it is a messenger) to our cells how to make a protein that triggers an immune response in our bodies.,Then, the immune system produces antibodies, and these antibodies protect us from getting severely sick when we get in contact with the virus.,I have also seen videos of people saying that they cannot take the vaccine because these vaccines were developed so fast, thus, they do not trust them. Again, thanks to the science behind mRNA vaccines and the dire situation this pandemic has placed the entire world in, the new vaccines were made fast.,For the first time in history, scientists considerably collaborated effectively and faster than ever before. Heads of governments were quick to respond and avail funds to support pharmaceutical companies to make these vaccines (which had been rarely done before) and the prior knowledge that vaccines work.,Smallpox and rinderpest (also known as cattle plague) diseases eradication and the decrease in under-five mortality thanks to the global coverage of vaccination against many infectious diseases of childhood with the expanded programme of immunization are the best examples. In other words, the collaboration, government support and the urgency of the situation justifies the fast processes.,Large clinical trials are still under way. Preliminary results from these trials helped establish the efficacy of the vaccines currently being used.,I have heard also people who say that they fear the unknown long-term side effects of the vaccine. It is true, no one knows yet. The same way we do not fully know the sequelea of COVID-19. Studies are underway, stay tuned.,All in all, I know that this a personal decision, however, I would like to encourage everyone to make a well-informed decision. If you are a healthcare provider, please take the vaccine. Remember you are at a higher risk of contracting the virus and we need you to take care of others.     ,.",politics

Unfortunately, there is widespread of false and incorrect information disseminated on the matter by the Sudan. With the objective of setting the record straight and relaying accurate information, the Embassy of the Federal Republic of Ethiopia in Rwanda presents this note.,The boundary of Ethiopia and Sudan was delimited by the 1902 Treaty signed between Emperor Menelik of Ethiopia and Great Britain, the colonial power of Sudan. Article 2 of the Treaty establishes a Joint Boundary Commission (JBC) to marking and delimiting the boundary on the ground.,However, in 1903 a British surveyor by the name of “Charles Gwynn” unilaterally demarcated the boundary disregarding the 1902 Treaty.  Ethiopia rejected it and communicated its position that the unilateral exercise by Great Britain is void.  ,In 1972, after a lengthy dialogue and negotiation, Ethiopia and Sudan adopted an Exchange of Notes that provides for the agreement of the two countries to re-demarcate the boundary. In the re-demarcation exercise, Ethiopia and Sudan agreed to use the “Gwynn Line” only as a basis and to make rectifications to it.,The 1972 Exchange of Notes is an outcome of compromise on the parts of both Ethiopia and Sudan. Ethiopia agreed to work on the re-demarcation, taking the “Gwynn Line” into consideration. Sudan agreed to drop its position that “Gwynn Line” is the final demarcation, and accepted the re-demarcation of the boundary based on mutually agreed rectifications. Hence, the 1972 Exchange of Notes makes it abundantly clear that Major Gwynn’s demarcation is not final and conclusive.,In line with the Exchange of Notes, Ethiopia and Sudan established joint mechanisms to deal with border re-demarcation. These include, the Joint Boundary Commission (JBC), the Joint Technical Boundary Committee (JTBC) established under the JBC, and the Joint Special Committee. The Special Committee also conducted important discussions. Nevertheless, all the committees have not yet completed their mandated tasks.,In carrying out the re-demarcation process, both countries will, among many other things, apply the 1972 Exchange of Notes, rules and standards for border demarcation, including settlement pattern, effective control and most importantly the durability of the boundary and border stability. In the meantime, Ethiopia and Sudan have an obligation to respect the status-quo.,Most recently, the Prime Ministers of Ethiopia and Sudan established a High Level Political Committee on Boundary Issues that was tasked to deliberate on reactivation of the boundary demarcation mechanisms.,In its meeting held in Addis Ababa on 16 – 17 May 2020, the High-Level Politic Committee reached an agreement to continue to work towards the resolution of the boundary issues within the existing frameworks and agreements as well to strengthen cooperation to combat illegal activities and reactivate people-to-people relations.,Sudan, in its recent act of invasion violated these solemn commitments. The acts of Sudan have entailed loss of mutual trust and spoiled the efforts made to create a stable and economically and socially vibrant border area.,The Sudanese National Army violated the basic principles of international law and peaceful settlement of disputes and invaded Ethiopia in early November 2020 while Ethiopian National Defense Force was engaged in the law enforcement measure in the Tigray Regional State.,The areas that the Sudan invaded are under the effective administration of Ethiopia before and since the signature of the 1902 Treaty, and most certainly since the conclusion of the 1972 Exchange of Notes.,In 2004/2005, the Joint Selected Working Group of Ethiopia and Sudan conducted aerial survey and registration of holdings. This undertaking established that, Ethiopians reside and conduct regular economic and social and political activities, west of the “Gwynn Line” governed by Ethiopian law and Ethiopian authorities.,Ethiopia’s resolve for peaceful settlement of the controversy was manifested even after Sudan invaded Ethiopia’s territory. The Sudanese side denied the invasion and declined the offer by Ethiopia to peacefully and diplomatically address the matter.,Ethiopia remains committed to finding lasting solution through negotiation and agreements in the framework of the existing normative and institutional mechanisms to re-demarcate the boundary and settle the controversy.",politics

Long, messy and expensive legal battle ensue involving the developer, the bank and the buyers.,There are no winners. The buyers’ dreams of owning a home have become their worst nightmare.,Below, I consider a few things first time buyers can do to protect themselves when purchasing a house.,Doing due diligence on the property you intend to buy is probably one of the most important steps you can take to protect yourself. This means doing research on the property to determine that everything is in good order. It is important to establish whether the property is the subject of a caveat, a mortgage or an ongoing dispute.,By simply dialing *651# on your phone and following the prompts, including providing the UPI number of the land where the house is located, you can establish whether there is a caveat or a mortgage over the property.,It is advisable to do an additional search by requesting the developer to write to the Registrar of Land Titles of the province where the land is situated and requesting for the same information. This request can only be made by the developer who is the owner of the land.,A caveat means that somebody who is not the current registered owner of the property has registered a claim with the Registrar of Land Titles over the same property. This claim prevents any transaction on the property from happening until the caveat has been lifted.,This normally arises when there is a dispute over the ownership of the land and then one or several of the parties to the dispute, request the Registrar of Titles or court to place a caveat on the land.,If there is a caveat on the property, this is a red flag and it is not advisable for you to continue with the purchase as you may get entangled in a long, messy and expensive dispute.,If you really must continue with the transaction, it is best to wait until the disputes over the property have been fully resolved and the rightful owner determined.,Even if there is no caveat, it is still prudent to find out the previous ownership of the house so as to reduce the risk of purchasing a property whose ownership is disputed or which has been acquired fraudulently. In Rwanda, fraud cases over property are relatively very low compared to other countries in the region, however, it is better to be safe than sorry.,If your search or the Developer reveals that there is a mortgage, it is an indication that the developer has a loan with a financial institution (normally a bank). This is not unusual as some developers rely on additional financing from banks to undertake their housing projects. A mortgage is a legal agreement which states that in case a borrower fails to pay a loan, the lender will have a right to sell the property which is the subject of the agreement and pay itself first from the proceeds of the sale and if there is any balance, it will give it to the borrower.,In law, a bank which has mortgage over the property has a much greater claim to the property than a buyer who has signed a house purchase contract and has paid the full purchase price for the house. Therefore, if the developer was to default on the loan to the bank, the bank would have a right to take over the property and sell it to someone else even if you, the buyer had already paid the developer the full purchase price.,If you establish that the property is under a mortgage, it is important to ask the developer to have the mortgage released by the bank before you can buy the property. Alternatively, you can enter into a direct contract with the developer’s Bank in which it commits to release the mortgage before or as soon you pay the purchase price.  ,Or, you can structure your payments to the developer in such a way that, you pay as little as possible upfront as a deposit and the remaining balance of the purchase price is paid after obtaining the title deed to the house with no mortgage.,That way you only stand to lose your small deposit in case the developer defaults on its loan and the developer’s bank takes over the property. However, the developer may not want to sign over the transfer of title to you before receiving the balance on the purchase price as the developer is not sure that you will pay it after you have received the title deed.,A possible solution is to pay the balance to a trusted third party like your bank, which will keep the balance on behalf of both you and the developer until the title has been transferred to you and then the third party will pay the balance to the developer. This concept is called an escrow. If you are borrowing money from your Bank to finance your purchase, this will provide further comfort to you as your bank will act as the trusted third party and will also facilitate the process of the developer’s bank releasing the mortgage on the title.,Lastly, it is important to critically review the house purchase contract. Many Buyers think that their contract is written in stone. They do not realize that the terms can be changed. Moreover, sometimes the developer pressures the buyer into signing the contract by claiming that the contract is standard and all other buyers have accepted to sign it without any modifications.,Even if this were true, simply because every other buyer has signed a contract without requesting any changes, does not mean you should too. It is advisable to have a lawyer look at the house purchase contract. ,Many buyers fear to hire the services of a lawyer because they believe lawyers are expensive. They are willing to risk making a mistake worth several million francs in order to save a few hundred thousand francs in lawyer fees which is simply not smart.,Owning a home is the dream for many of us. Taking a few simple precautions can prevent this dream from becoming your worst nightmare.",politics

Day
","On Monday, 8th March, Rwandan corporations like the rest of the world put their best foot forward to mark International Women’s Day (IWD). Some posted endearing messages on social media and any available platforms while others handed roses and candy to their employees and clients.,In the process, speeches and posts were made about the women composition in their respective companies and boards as well as how much they are inspired by the women.,In the process, there were commitments made to increasingly ensure that their respective ecosystems are conducive for women.,In some instances, this is the only time in the year that women feature as a priority in the institutions.,However, as the roses wither and the speeches echo away, this would be a good time to commence the implementation and actualization of commitments made to challenge the status quo.,This would be a good time to commence looking inward at interventions that would address challenges that women working in their institutions work.,For instance, while maternity leave is no longer an issue in most organizations, more can be done to improve the work environments. For instance, with the exception of a few local private institutions, maternity leave does not exceed 3 months.,It is also not uncommon to come across instances whereby firms may be hesitant to hire women or promote them to certain positions for fear that they could be away during maternity leave.,It is also not uncommon to find instances of women held back from certain jobs, roles as they have previously not been found to be ‘female roles.’,While multiple studies have revealed that firms with higher levels of gender diversity, and policies and practices have increased creativity and innovation, only a few firms have moved in to improve their environment and workspaces for women.,As opposed to waiting for 2022 March to prioritize women, it is time to go beyond the speeches, social media posts and flowers to put their money where their words are.",politics
https://www.newtimes.co.rw/opinions/where-justice-and-architecture-meet,"Where justice and architecture meet
","Rwanda’s Supreme Court has moved to a new building in Kacyiru. It is a striking structure, all glass and stuff, not the sort usually associated with courts of law. The old building in Kimihurura wasn’t much different, just an unremarkable square structure with a part of it sticking up into the sky.,It is not usual for the Supreme Court in any country to move house. So when it does you take notice. There must be a good reason or some other significance.,The court building is normally one of those key landmarks in the capital that serve as reference points, recognisable for their permanence and unique architecture and function. You don’t have to be told whether a particular building is a courthouse, parliament or government office. They have features that identify them as such.,Neither the old building of the Supreme Court, nor the new one have any distinguishing features in the traditional sense that mark them as a temple of justice. That is perhaps why it is easy to move it without as much as a murmur in support or protest.,There is another sense in which you would be struck by the relocation and the new home of the Supreme Court if, like me, you spent a good part of your life in places where courts have a different architectural design.,In the old East Africa (Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania) court buildings were impregnable structures, fortresses really, ugly and forbidding, and apparently designed to intimidate, not to inspire confidence. And then there is archaic dress and language, and strange rituals to match, all intended to awe but also befuddle.,Not surprisingly, ordinary people approach them with trepidation, unsure whether they will get any justice at all. Some even fear they will be sent to jail even when they have not committed or been accused of any crime.,These architectural and even philosophical differences have roots in the history of the respective countries in the region. In traditional East Africa, courts were a British creation and were meant to serve imperial interests. For this they had to be housed in structures that were intimidating to natives. The British intended to stay for a long time and so created permanent structures and systems that resembled what they had at home and reflected their intentions in the colonies.,In Rwanda on the other hand, the Belgians did not build anything that suggested intentions of permanence and so did not put up any remarkable or lasting structures, especially architectural. Or perhaps they were disdainful of the natives to bother with any elaborate infrastructure.,In terms of justice, they administered a rough form of it and for this they did not need uniquely designed structures, except, of course, prisons.,This reluctance or inability was perhaps a reflection of a feeling of insecurity arising out of their own inadequacy as an imperial power. After all Rwanda had been dropped into their laps by circumstances of history. It was acquired as part of the spoils of war and punishment of Germany after World War I.,Rwanda was different in another sense. It had its own institutionalised national justice system, delivered in the open, accessible to all citizens and in which they all participated. More importantly, they believed in it.,Rwandans are good at litigation. They will go to court for the slightest suspicion of injustice. They were even more so in the past. Nearly everyone was an expert on court proceedings and could tell where court had been fair or biased and would be sure to remind the authorities of this whenever an opportunity arose.,Those things that Rwandans valued are indeed the principle that underpins justice even today: openness, fairness, equality before the law, both in reality and perception. It is also what every palace of justice should be: open and accessible, inspire trust and confidence, and not cause fear and apprehension.,It shouldn’t therefore come as a surprise that we are seeing evidence of it today in the ongoing case of Paul Rusesabagina and his FLN associates. It is part of the tradition, not something done to please some noisy outsiders.,The new home of the Supreme Court should be seen in this light of a tradition of openness (apart, of course, from the practical necessity of giving way to new developments). Openness and keeping with the times gives a sense of transparency and fairness, of the here and now and therefore more understanding and inclusion – a sort of people’s temple of justice.,The architecture must be part of it since it reflects the history, philosophy and values of a people. But that said, the Supreme Court needs a permanent home both as symbol and fact because that gives it a sense of solidity, endurance and reliability.",politics

","Rwanda joined the rest of the world to celebrate International Women’s Day on Monday, March 8, 2021. Organisations, businesses, families, and society, in general, took time to celebrate how far we have come in achieving gender equality. ,However, Covid-19 has reminded us that we still have a long way to go to challenge biases. When Covid-19 hit and lockdowns were put in place to slow its spread, reports of women having to bear the brunt were rife.,Cases of domestic conflict increased and to make matters worse, leaving an abusive relationship during a lockdown was even more complicated for a society that frowns upon women leaving their marital homes. ,On the employment front, there were two main challenges; job loss is one of them. Experts argue that gender segregation in the labour market contributed to women finding employment in areas that were mostly affected by the pandemic.,These include cross-border trade and foodservice chain. The other is the work-from-home directive that most employers put in place to keep their staff safe. In addition to doing their official duties while at home, there were other responsibilities such as domestic chores and childcare/home-schooling as everyone had to stay home. ,As we celebrate the achievements of women, it is imperative that we build on the existing efforts and policies to ensure that women are protected from unforeseen situations including pandemics. ,Take for example the construction sector. It was one of the areas that have resumed work after lockdowns are partially lifted. If contractors pledge to ensure a substantial percentage of workers are women, the rewards would be far-reaching. ,And, as a society, we must have more conversations about changing the mindset that domestic chores and child-care are the responsibility of the women only.,If this was collectively perceived to be a shared responsibility, the work-from-home directives would not have placed extra responsibility on women. We must continually challenge such biases. ",politics

","International Women’s Day is an opportunity to reflect on the progress our societies have made and to recommit to building a world where all young women have the chance to realise their full potential, regardless of their gender or background.,According to the McKinsey Global Institute, the COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected women and further exacerbated gender inequality. Women around the world are more vulnerable to the effects of the pandemic due to the unbalanced burden of unpaid work such as childcare, household chores and caring for the elderly.,Indeed, many sectors hit hardest by the pandemic are gendered in nature - tourism and hospitality, health, as well as education are just a few examples. The informal sector - crippled by the pandemic - is majority female. Findings from the Labour Force Survey, indicate that in 2019, 91.2% women were informally employed.,By taking a gender lens to remove barriers to employment, , has learnt a number of lessons as we build African solutions to the global challenge of youth unemployment. We know that these barriers are higher for women than men. In the last three years of supporting young Rwandans to secure income-generating opportunities, we have identified four key lessons that we know can enable women to reach their full potential.,Ernestine Turabayo is a young mother living in Kigali who provides for her family alongside raising her child. Previously, she didn’t have the time or money to attend Harambee’s four-week in-person English Acceleration Programme. It was only after we began offering online training that she was able to participate.,Ernestine told us: ,Our fifth English Acceleration cohort saw a 10% increase in female completion - up to 53% from 43% for our previous four cohorts, which required in-person participation. By designing online and flexible programmes for women’s realities, which often include household and familial responsibilities, we have seen increased participation and completion of programmes that are now specifically designed to open more earning opportunities for them.,Since we began working in Rwanda, we have seen less participation from women in our programmes (41% on average). To address this, and draw on the early successes of women-focused sessions with partners like Fawe and Maranyundo Girls school, we introduced women-only online Work-Seeker Support (WSS) sessions. We quickly realised the enthusiasm among some women for this offering.,Divine, who attended one of the sessions, told us: ,By creating spaces for women to share their experiences in finding a job and building their networks, Harambee aims to empower and accelerate their pathways to learning and earning opportunities.,Joselyne Iradukunda was one of the first candidates Harambee pathwayed to an opportunity with one of our employer partners, Volkswagen Mobility Solutions. VW was looking to hire drivers and was equally committed to making the opportunity available to women - even though driving in Rwanda is often seen as a traditionally male role.,According to Joselyne, “,This outcome was made possible thanks to the shared commitment of Harambee and VW to make all opportunities open to women, and a commitment to supporting them in their employment journey.,Rwanda stands out for its commitment and achievements in elevating women to leadership positions. Female representation in Parliament stands at 61% and women’s representation in middle management in the private sector has increased by 27%, according to McKinsey.,We have learned that in addition to supporting young women, sharing success stories is a critical force multiplier. This inspires more young women to keep progressing in their employment journey. Sharing stories on radio, social media and in our programmes has allowed women to see the diverse career pathways other women have navigated, and therefore made subsequent paths much clearer.,Incorporating these lessons has enabled us to lower the barriers for women to both training and employment opportunities, but there is more work to be done to remove those barriers completely. On International Women’s Day, Harambee is committed to continuing to learn, iterate, and scale to achieve gender equity in earning opportunities for Rwanda’s young people.",politics

But this year, set against the backdrop of heightened gender inequities, we should leverage it to collectively advocate for tangible, systematic changes for women, as a sustainable movement that transcends the confines of a single day.,This year’s IWD campaign theme ‘#ChooseToChallenge’ calls on individuals to advocate for gender equity in their respective communities. Yet institutions must also recognize, to promote equity and mainstream gender, both inwards - by taking a mirror to their own organizational structure - and outwards - by taking steps to initiate and contribute to, movements that promote women.,The University of Global Health Equity (,), a global health sciences university based in Rwanda, is one organization committed to taking explicit steps to create equity within its community and globally.,Equity in health starts with equity in education, a concept immediately visible in UGHE’s student recruitment structure where women comprise 70% of its medical cohort and 100% of students receive needs-based financial support to study. ,This deliberate structure goes beyond the traditional process of shortlisting and selecting candidates, and takes into account , - like domestic responsibilities, early marriage and pregnancy, and financial barriers - that limit high-school girls’ access to further education.,UGHE addresses this by visiting all-girls schools across the country, introducing students to female role-models from its student and alumni network, taking entry-exam sites to all provinces, and providing immersive science days on campus to subvert ingrained gender norms that discourage girls from studying STEM.,These gender norms contribute to why women hold ,, and make up less than 30% of the world's researchers. Role models have significant influencing power in addressing gaps in female scientists, researchers and global health leaders, and strong mentorship programs help institutionalize this by fostering transfer of knowledge across diverse disciplines to support young women navigate the often-labyrinthine path to leadership.,Comprising of 67% and 92.5% female mentees and mentors, respectively, UGHE’s Center for Gender Equity (CGE)’s pioneering Mentorship Program focuses on providing actionable frameworks for successful mentoring that serve both parties; with mentors benefitting as much from the process as mentees.,Similarly, the path to gender equity ought to focus on strategically planned, actionable goals. Organizations with a self-professed gender agenda must look at their own internal structures, assess the ingrained gender bias, identify gaps in supportive networks and resources for women, and analyze the culture that may adversely affect women ascending into leadership roles. ,The CGE, whose purpose is to , throughout UGHE, is taking action through a first-of-its-kind Gender and Diversity Inclusion audit, studying academic activities, student and community engagement and gender and diversity sensitivity in the organizational culture and practices.,The participatory audit mobilized a diverse task force and collected input from all genders and minority groups at every organizational level through Kinyarwanda and English self-assessment questionnaires, individual in-depth staff interviews and a quantitative review of institutional policies.,Today, there is simply no excuse not to make workplaces more inclusive to women. , and yet the majority of workspaces around the world are not adapted to support new mothers, or agile working to help women balance childcare responsibilities with those at work.,UGHE’s inclusion of a mother’s room in Kigali and on its Butaro Campus provides a private, hygienic space for lactating mothers to breastfeed or pump and store breast milk. , UGHE’s students who menstruate are provided with free sanitary pads.,Such explicit ‘gendered’ steps are necessary to overcome existing power dynamics and social norms that limit women’s participation. In Butaro, UGHE’s Department of Community Health & Social Medicine is creating formal frameworks to guarantee women’s voices are heard, and further ensures inclusion by providing oral and sign language translators during communal activities.,UGHE also mandates its contractors and service providers to have an 80% locally sourced, 50% female labor force. Upcoming initiatives such as carpentry programs and mobilizing funding to support small Butaro-based businesses affected by the pandemic, are all attached to quotas to guarantee female participation.,By taking deliberate, participatory steps to ensure a gender agenda in both internal operations and external activities, organizations can collectively shift the dial towards a more gender-equal world.

A 2020 UN Women report -,, estimates that “the pandemic will push an additional 96 million people into extreme poverty by 2021, 47 million of whom are women and girls”.,Despite the fact that they have been disproportionately impacted by Covid-19, women have once again demonstrated their courage, strength and resilience in the pandemic preparedness and response, in Rwanda, in the UAE and all over the world from the top leadership down to the communities and families.,When I reflect on the role that women play from being pillars of family to nation and peacebuilding, the only question I ask myself is: “We have inherited a gender-imbalanced society but what are we doing to bridge the gap?”,The Covid-19 pandemic and its impact are a stark reminder of the urgency needed to step up action towards gender equality and women empowerment.,Tremendous effort and reforms have been deployed to change the status-quo inherited in the last two decades, including in Rwanda and the UAE and today we celebrate women in leadership positions across national, regional and global institutions.,In the most recent past, the world applauded the election of Nigerian Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala as the Director-General of the World Trade Organisation, the election of Rwandan economist Dr Monique Nsanzabaganwa as the vice-chairperson of the African Union Commission, the election of Hon. Louise Mushikiwabo as the fourth and current Secretary-General of , and many more.,One can draw parallels with the equally laudable successful Hope Probe Mission to Mars, a vision of the UAE leadership come true and the magnificent groundbreaking World Expo2020 officially starting in October of 2021 in Dubai both historic in the sense of the word with women leaders at the helm.,These women trailblazers continue to be the shining light that young ladies follow and emulate along their path. Undoubtedly, women ascension to decision-making positions works to reaffirm their potentials, the world trust them and acts as a good opportunity to drive and support the gender equality agenda across nations.,Reflecting on the much-needed political will, Rwanda and the UAE share a common vision with regard to women empowerment. High levels of women participation in the UAE Cabinet, distribution of positions in government institutions by gender with women making up 66 per cent of the public sector workforce in UAE, as according to the UAE Gender Balance Council recent data, the country is arguably leading the region in gender parity.,After the devastating effects of the 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi which destroyed the socioeconomic fabric of Rwanda, the government placed gender equality and women empowerment at the forefront as full recovery could only be possible with women and men equally contributing to the country’s vision for development.,Rwandan women have taken advantage of these opportunities and made major strides in realizing their dreams while changing the world around them. Deliberate gender equality policies by Rwanda’s Government have paid off.,Rwanda is now a global leader in women participation in legislative decision-making positions with 61.3% female members of Parliament and also ranked 9th globally in closing gender gaps according to the Global Gender Gap Report, 2020. In addition, 52% of the Cabinet members are women, among the Judges and clerks, women stand at 49.7% while in the local government leadership, women occupy 45.2 % as Members of District Councils.,Given the country’s recent history, Rwanda understands best the cost of insecurity and the responsibility to protect. In the UN peacekeeping missions, Rwanda has the second-highest number of women peacekeepers who contribute to peace and relief around the world. Wars and disasters everywhere affect women and children disproportionately, it is always important to have a woman’s voice and helping hand next to a woman victim in time of need.,In the education sector, gender parity has been stable with girl’s enrollment standing at 49.5% against 50.5% of male at primary level while the enrolment of girls in secondary education increased to reach 53.3% against 46.7% of boys’ enrollment, according to 2019 Education Statistics of the Ministry of Education.,Economically women and girls have the same access rights to land ownership and inheritance as their brothers do in Rwanda. Suffice to say, Rwanda’s progress in women empowerment is a result of a solid foundation laid by the highest political will, deliberate legal and policy frameworks among other mechanisms.,As we mark the International Women’s Day of 2021, a lot remains to be done to achieve gender equality, let us all together strive for a world where equality and equity prevail., ",politics

The vaccines are very effective at significantly reducing the worst effects of a coronavirus infection and, we learned this week, at reducing , of the virus. It took a while for vaccine availability to ramp up, but by now many states have vastly expanded the pool of people for whom inoculations are available. The country has secured (if not yet obtained) , the vaccine supply needed to inoculate every adult American.,So what bad vaccine news is out there? For one: that so many adult Americans still don’t want the shot.,There has been repeated polling on the issue of vaccine hesitancy, linking it, among other things, to ,. Data from the Household Pulse Survey conducted by the Census Bureau in partnership with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows , in that regard. Since January, the percentage of Americans saying that they won’t get vaccinated has fallen from 8.6 to 7.8 percent. That includes about 8 percent of White and Hispanic Americans and 9.5 percent of Black Americans.,As you might expect, views of vaccination vary widely by state. In some places, such as Vermont, nearly everyone either indicates a desire to be vaccinated or reports having already received a vaccine dose. In other states, such as North Dakota, hesitancy is far more common. In every state, though, the percentage of people saying either that they got a vaccine dose (and plan to complete the regimen) and those who say they definitely will get the vaccine has increased since January.,In part that’s because some portion of the hesitancy stemmed from concern about the vaccines’ potential effects. In January, about a quarter of those who hadn’t been vaccinated said they would wait to see if the vaccine was safe; by March, only one-fifth did.,But there are other concerns, ones that seem less readily overcome. About 10 percent of those who hadn’t received a dose cited a lack of trust in government as a reason for not getting vaccinated, about the same as the percentage in January.,This is a complicated, novel situation, obviously, and officials have been deliberate in trying to show the effectiveness and safety of the vaccines even as they highlight the utility in mass vaccination. (In short, the United States can either reach broad immunity through vaccines or through infections, and only the latter poses a significant risk of long-term health effects or death.) What’s also clear, though, is that politics continues to drive responses to the vaccines.,We can overlap the census data by state vote in 2020. That allows us to see, for example, that the percentage of people saying they would definitely not get vaccinated dropped in all but 17 states. Of those, 12 states supported Donald Trump in last year’s election. Of the 22 states in which the percentage of residents who say they definitely won’t be vaccinated is at or above 9 percent, all but four voted for Trump.,There are still eight states in which less than 60 percent of residents either have gotten or definitely plan to get vaccinated. Seven of them voted for Trump in 2020. The eighth, Georgia, narrowly preferred Joe Biden.,All of that aside, though, red states have done a better job to date in getting older Americans vaccinated. In 21 states, at least two-thirds of those age 65 and older say they’ve gotten a dose and will complete the regimen. Of those states, 14 backed Trump.,It’s easy to dive deep into this one bit of bad news and miss the very good news about the vaccines. For example, it’s easy to focus on the 8 percent who say they won’t get vaccinated instead of the 80-plus percent nationally who say they have been vaccinated and will or probably will get the shot. That percentage is , the country’s top infectious-disease expert, Anthony S. Fauci, has said we need to be to reach herd immunity, although these data are only for adults. (On Wednesday, Pfizer , that its vaccine was effective among teenagers, as well.),The country will reach herd immunity at some point. Ideally, it’s through broad distribution of vaccines. But it will otherwise happen as people get infected, fall ill and, in some instances, die.,It’s easy to see why the experts prefer the first option.",politics

Ron DeSantis, who is considered a potential 2024 presidential candidate.,“We are not supporting doing any vaccine passports in the state of Florida,” DeSantis said Monday. “It’s completely unacceptable for either the government or the private sector to impose upon you the requirement that you show proof of vaccine to just simply be able to participate in normal society.”,Other Republicans have used more inflammatory rhetoric, with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) calling the passport idea “Biden’s Mark of the Beast” and some conservative activists comparing it with Nazi policies to identify Jews.,The hyper-charged rhetoric is directed at a nascent initiative between the Biden administration and private companies to develop a standard way for Americans to show they have received a coronavirus vaccination. The idea behind the passports or certificates is that they would be a way to ensure that people could return to normal activities without risking further spread of a virus that has ,.,Unlike some of the recent attacks from conservatives focused on cultural or economic issues that centered on , and , this one focuses directly on the Biden administration and taps into a long-standing warning from the right: that a powerful federal government will try to control the population.,“There’s been this pent-up opposition to lockdowns and mask mandates and so this is building on that,” said David Boaz, executive vice president of the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank. “Now there’s this suggestion that if you don’t get a vaccine, you might not be able to do — we’re not quite sure what. I can see how there’s a market for that concern.”,The attacks also focus on an area that’s been a strength for Biden: his handling of the pandemic. Under Biden’s watch, vaccine distribution has significantly ramped up  and, according to federal survey data, reports of vaccine hesitancy are decreasing. Covid-19 deaths have also plummeted from January highs, in part because larger portions of older Americans have been inoculated. But there’s been an uptick in infections in recent days as states have relaxed coronavirus restrictions.,Now the effort by some Republicans to create doubt about a vaccine passport program threatens to define the Biden administration effort while it’s still in the earliest phase, blunting its ability to roll out an idea that could be a popular project and putting the administration on the defensive.,The discussion around a passport has been led by various industries, including airlines, entertainment venues and sports leagues. Biden administration officials have repeatedly said there will be no national mandate.,Matt Gorman, a Republican strategist, said the fierce opposition from many in the party spawned organically and called the news that the White House is working with the business community on vaccine passports or certificates “a trial balloon that went over like a lead balloon.”,“A healthy distrust of government when it comes to health care is nothing new,” said Gorman, who used to work for the National Republican Congressional Committee. “It’s a line of messaging that has been very successful to Republicans going back to Obamacare and the like.”,Paul Matzko, a historian and author of “The Radio Right,” a volume on how the conservative movement grew via talk radio, said a Democrat in the White House typically coincides with conspiracy theories growing on the right.,The current fervor over a vaccine passport feeds into existing conservative narratives that Democratic administrations try to track and control the population.,“This is a very old concern — this idea of globalized elites with a sinister plan for the world who are going to take away American sovereignty,” Matzko said.,“They want us to be seen, we can’t escape them, we have a mark, whether it is a passport, or a chip or a bar code,” Matzko added, explaining the various manifestations of this theory. “It’s kind of outlandish.”,The conservative attacks were launched after the White House took on a more significant role coordinating a private-sector-initiated vaccine passport effort — with administration officials preferring to refer to it as “vaccine verification” — as aides work with dozens of federal agencies to identify what vaccination data is available and how the passports could best be deployed, said five officials with knowledge of the efforts who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the private deliberations.,Some federal agencies are actively working to help provide vaccine passports to their staff or people who use their services. The Department of Veterans Affairs, which provides health care to millions of military veterans, is “implementing a VA-issued vaccine credential,” , obtained by The Post.,The passport plan builds off work led by the Department of Health and Human Services to ensure that in-development passport data systems meet privacy and accessibility standards and are protected against fraud.,A wide range of private-sector and nonprofit organizations, including Microsoft and the World Health Organization, have been pursuing a range of possible systems, with IBM working with the state of New York to pilot one passport.,Biden administration officials have said they’re trying to strike a delicate political balance: help coordinate the ongoing push for vaccine passports without it being perceived as government-driven or as White House overreach.,“From a Federal perspective, vaccines and vaccine credentials are matters of individual choice — there is no mandate for either,” according to internal HHS slides obtained by The Washington Post. But the ubiquity of vaccine passports, driven by the private sector, “could become perceived as a Federal mandate even though there is none.”,White House coronavirus coordinator Jeff Zients echoed some of those points Tuesday in a call with governors, according to a recording obtained by The Washington Post.,“We’re not going to have any federally mandated, universal vaccine credential, and there will not be a federal database,” Zients said in response to questions by North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper (D), promising more information in the coming weeks.,Officials also have been holding calls with business leaders, seeking to gauge their interest in vaccine passports and understand new concerns as the issue has become increasingly politicized.,Asked about the project Monday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki described the  administration effort as “focused on guidelines.”,Psaki also noted that there will not be a centralized federal database showing who in the country has received vaccinations and there are no plans for any federal  mandate that all citizens have a vaccination credential.,She declined to provide any timeline about when  federal guidance on the issue might be released.,A growing number of travel and entertainment businesses have said they will require customers to prove they have been vaccinated, but some major businesses have said they remain undecided.,Carnival Corp. spokesman Roger Frizzell said the cruise-line giant was “encouraged” by recent vaccination breakthroughs but closely monitoring the “evolving situation” before imposing vaccine requirements. Carnival’s fleet includes the Diamond Princess and the Grand Princess, both of which became epicenters of coronavirus clusters in 2020.,DeSantis has promised an executive order barring Florida from participating in any vaccination credentialing efforts and is urging the state’s legislature to act as well. The governor has become a leading opponent of pandemic restrictions and has often dismissed the advice of public health experts who have criticized his downplaying the importance of masks and other precautions.,Some Republicans are supportive of a passport program.,Longtime GOP pollster Frank Luntz said he’s working with the Bethesda, Md.-based de Beaumont Foundation, a public health organization, to survey voters on their reactions to vaccination passports, identify which messages were resonating and understand whether “passports” is the right term to describe the credentials.,“It’s been politicized in two different directions,” said Luntz, arguing that liberals worry that a passport would widen inequities around who has access to vaccines and that conservatives fear it would limit their freedoms.,Luntz said the growing politicization around the passports also threatened the entire initiative. “Unless the Biden administration tempers both sides down right now, they will find within days it becomes impossible to do. I’ve seen this movie and it doesn’t have a good ending,” he said.,Some Democratic pollsters also acknowledge the issue could have some resonance, depending on how Biden handles the situation.,Republicans do have concerns that Democrats, particularly in coordination with large technology firms, are seeking broad control over the citizenry, said Stan Greenberg, a Democratic pollster. “This will fit that narrative,” Greenberg said. “But that’s not America as a whole.”,He said it’s unclear where conservatives will wage battles over vaccination requirements, and he noted that schools and employers probably will require proof of vaccination.,“I just think it puts them into an incredibly marginal position,” Greenberg said.,One key to where the party goes on the issue of passports will probably be whether former president Donald Trump weighs in on the issue.,Barry Bennett, a former Trump adviser, said the paranoia is probably overblown, and instead likened the passport idea to the yellow fever vaccination card he shows when traveling to countries in Africa.,“For someone who travels international a great deal, I want to be able to prove in a secure format that I’ve been vaccinated so I can go see my clients,” Bennett said. “If you’re talking about having to show papers to get into 7-Eleven to get a Slurpee, I think that’s paranoia. I think people are talking past each other, which is typical Washington.”,

Gaetz has separately insisted his family is being extorted, a claim that is being investigated by the FBI.,Neither Gaetz’s office nor a Fox News spokesperson immediately responded to a request for comment from The Washington Post early Wednesday.,The interview on “Tucker Carlson Tonight” capped a stunning few hours of news about the Florida lawmaker, who had been investigated for months in secret by Justice Department officials.,After , about the inquiry on Tuesday afternoon, Gaetz, and said the allegations were false. He also claimed the probe was “rooted” in a $25 million extortion effort against his family.,In a separate story, , that Gaetz, a three-term congressman, has expressed doubts about seeking reelection in 2022 and has even considered the possibility of leaving early for a job at the conservative media outlet Newsmax.,On Tuesday evening, the lawmaker appeared on “Tucker Carlson Tonight,” slamming the Times report as an attempt to thwart a separate investigation into his extortion claims. Gaetz insisted there was no 17-year-old and denied any allegations of sex trafficking.,“Providing for flights and hotel rooms for people that you’re dating who are of legal age is not a crime,” he told Carlson.,Gaetz specifically blamed the extortion attempt on David McGee, a former Justice Department official. McGee ,, saying he had no connection to the agency’s probe into possible sex trafficking by Gaetz.,At one point, in what appeared to be an effort to get Carlson to relate to his circumstances, the lawmaker mentioned that the Fox News host was falsely accused of rape years ago.,“I’m not the only person on screen right now who’s been falsely accused of a terrible sex act,” the lawmaker told Tucker Carlson. “You were accused of something you did not do, so you know what this feels like.”,With a puzzled look on his face, Carlson responded: “You just referred to a mentally ill viewer who accused me of a sex crime 20 years ago. And of course, it was not true. I never met the person.”,It was not immediately clear what allegations Gaetz was referring to, or if they had been previously disclosed. In , for ,, Carlson wrote that he had been falsely accused of felony rape several years before then by an accountant in Indiana, a woman he “had literally never even seen.”,By the end of the segment, Carlson had not wiped a look of shock from his face.

Kavanaugh said.,Justice Elena Kagan was unimpressed when Washington lawyer Seth P. Waxman recounted the organization was created more than 100 years ago to “restore integrity and the social value of college athletics” against the threat of turning it into another version of professional sports.,“You can only ride on the history, I think, Mr. Waxman, for so long,” Kagan said, adding “I guess it doesn’t move me all that much that there’s a history to this if what is going on now is that competitors, as to labor, are combining to fix prices.”,Lawyers for the players and the Justice Department drew the distinction that the case was about opening educational benefits, rather than simply compensating athletes for their play.,But that still worried some justices about increasing the role of the judiciary in deciding what protects amateurism and what compromises it.,“It’s like a game of Jenga,” said Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. “You’ve got this nice solid block that protects the sort of product the schools want to provide, and you pull out one log and then another and everything’s fine, then another and another and all of a sudden the whole thing … comes crashing down.”,Justice Stephen G.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/03/31/matt-gaetz-allegation-explained/,"The Matt Gaetz allegation, explained","There aren’t many members of Congress whose personal lives are the subject of broad speculation. But for a variety of reasons, Rep. Matt Gaetz’s (R-Fla.) has been for some time.,One is that he’s a young and handsome bachelor, part of a handful of House members whose constant appearances on conservative cable television have earned him national attention. Another is that Gaetz has both intentionally and unintentionally stoked that interest, first with ,, then , and most unusually, the revelation last year that , (who is his son neither biologically nor legally).,So when the New York Times , Tuesday evening that the Justice Department was investigating Gaetz in relation to what he describes as a past relationship, the story quickly blew up. Then things got weird … er.,Let us explain.,“The Justice Department is investigating Rep. Matt Gaetz — a Florida Republican considered a close political ally of former president Donald Trump — over an alleged sexual relationship with an underage girl,” The Washington Post’s Matt Zapotosky and Devlin Barrett ,. That relationship allegedly included paying for the girl to travel, potentially across state lines, adding the complexity of potential federal charges related to sex trafficking, according to the Times. Both the Post and Times stories are constrained for fairly obvious reasons, including the limits of available information and the need to accurately convey the potential risk Gaetz faces.,The investigation apparently spun out of another sex-trafficking probe in Florida. That one focused on a former county official named Joel Greenberg, who was , with a number of federal offenses, including sex trafficking of a minor.,“According to an indictment in the case, Greenberg abused his access to a statewide database, using it to look up the personal information of people with whom he was in 'sugar daddy' relationships, including the minor, and to help produce fake identification documents to 'facilitate his efforts to engage in commercial sex acts,' "" Zapotosky and Barrett report. “He was also accused of seeking to undermine a political opponent by surfacing fabricated evidence of racism and misconduct.”,It's worth noting that questions about Gaetz's relationships have emerged in the past. A , from 2019 documents concerns raised by a former member of Gaetz's staff about a 21-year-old he was then dating and who was apparently posting photos of the two of them on Instagram alongside other photos showing not-conservative-politician-friendly activities.,Gaetz’s initial response to the Times focused on the travel aspect of the allegation, telling the paper that while he only knew that the investigation “has to do with women,” his suspicion was that “someone is trying to recategorize my generosity to ex-girlfriends as something more untoward.” He later told the paper that it was “verifiably false” that he had traveled with a minor.,Over the next few hours, though, his claims got much more complicated. He appeared on Tucker Carlson's Fox News show to explain his side of the story.,Here's what he said, in full.,Gaetz later looped Carlson into the allegations.,“You and I went to dinner about two years ago,” Gaetz said. “Your wife was there, and I brought a friend of mine. You’ll remember her. And she was actually threatened by the FBI, told that if she wouldn’t cop to the fact that somehow I was involved in some pay-for-play scheme, that she could face trouble.”,Carlson said he didn’t remember that dinner. He also asked Gaetz when the congressman first learned of the investigation, without receiving a specific answer.,It's hard to say, given the, shall we say, , of Gaetz's allegation. (Carlson himself described the interaction as “one of the weirdest interviews I've ever conducted.”) Gaetz apparently , messages and documents supporting his claims with Axios's Jonathan Swan, though Swan didn't offer details on what that material indicated.,During the Fox News interview, Gaetz identified the former official as David McGee. McGee spoke with The Post about the charge, saying that Gaetz’s father, Don Gaetz, had reached out to him. (The elder Gaetz is a former Florida politician who became rich after selling a hospice company he had co-founded.),“It is completely false. It’s a blatant attempt to distract from the fact that he’s under investigation for sex trafficking of minors,” McGee told The Post. He said he had no connection to the case other than being “one of a thousand people who have heard the rumors.”,Yep. Earlier Tuesday, news , that Gaetz was thinking of resigning from the House to take a job in conservative media. Outside of the context that emerged with the reported investigation, ,. Gaetz has been on Fox News an average of 87 minutes a month over the past 12 months; for a low-ranking member of the minority party with an affection for the spotlight to make such a transition wouldn’t be a shock.,With the new revelation, though, that story takes on a different color: Was that rumor floated simply as cover for Gaetz to resign for other reasons? (It’s worth noting that resignations from positions of power can be part of plea agreements.) Once we’re reconsidering Gaetz’s willingness to walk away from Congress, we might reconsider his , to resign from Congress to aid Trump’s impeachment defense. Was the impetus for that attention or, even then, some form of self-preservation?,Why, yes! Gaetz is a prolific user of social media and the kind of social media user who alternately deploys it for jokes or as a cudgel.,So we get jokes like this one from 2019, which age particularly poorly.,More curious was this one, which came after Gaetz himself acknowledges being familiar with the reported investigation.,Then there was his unusual vote on a bill focused on combating sex trafficking during his first year in Congress. The bill passed by a 418-to-1 vote — with Gaetz offering the only “nay.”,“Unless there is an overwhelming, compelling reason that our existing agencies in the federal government can’t handle that problem,” he later ,, “I vote no because voters in Northwest Florida did not send me to Washington to go and create more federal government.”,If Gaetz does resign, there’s no real risk that the GOP would lose his seat. Gaetz has won by at least 30 points in each of his reelection bids, and Trump , by more than 30 points last year.,But Gaetz’s position is shaky. The allegations are of a sort that makes it very difficult for his colleagues to come to his defense. Perhaps they believe his claims that he’s a target of extortion — a sort of countercharge that in the past has , to be untrue. But there’s an obvious political risk to vocally defending someone who might face sex-trafficking charges, so expect his political allies (including the former president) to remain fairly muted.,That’s particularly true, Insider ,, because Gaetz isn’t particularly well-liked by his colleagues. One called him “the meanest person in politics.”,Perhaps Gaetz can turn that to his defense. After all, if no one likes him much, wouldn’t that make it more possible that they might try to extort him?",politics

She also blamed Republican criticism for her decision to drop her appeal.,“Despite our best efforts to have every vote counted, the reality is that the toxic campaign of political disinformation to attack this constitutional review of the closest congressional contest in 100 years has effectively silenced the voices of Iowans,” Hart said.,Miller-Meeks was declared the winner over Hart following a recount in ,with a difference of just six votes out of 400,000 cast. Miller-Meeks is now serving as the district’s representative, but Hart had asked the House to overturn the result. Hart alleges that 22 legally cast ballots were not considered during the initial November canvass and subsequent recount, resulting in the tightest congressional electoral outcome in modern history.,Under the Constitution, the House has the right to determine the outcome of their own member’s elections and losers of a race can file an appeal without having to first sue in state court. The House Administration has been investigating the results of the race in Iowa’s second congressional district at Hart’s request.,In recent weeks, Republicans were quick to accuse Democrats of trying to overturn the results of an election just months after all Democrats voted to impeach former president Donald Trump for his role in Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, which they said was inspired by his false claims that his loss to Joe Biden was due to voter fraud. GOP leaders accused Hart of failing to first make an appeal in Iowa state courts and going directly to a Democratically-controlled House to get the results overturned.,House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) stood by Miller-Meeks in her Davenport, Iowa district Wednesday where he continued to accuse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Democrats of wanting to overturn the race to expand their slim majority.,“Do the Iowans have a voice in this race,” McCarthy said. “If Nancy Pelosi wants to pull that game — to try to pick and choose who — she’s going against the voice of Iowa’s 2nd District, and I think that’s wrong.”,A person familiar with Hart’s decision, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private discussions, said she no longer wanted to put her family through mounting negative and what they described as misleading attacks on her request to have the House overturn the election results.,The Administration Committee had just begun the discovery phase of the investigation before Hart’s announcement. They had received initial briefs from Hart and Miller-Meeks’ lawyers and paused consideration of dismissing Miller-Meek’s request to dismiss the investigation in an effort to garner more evidence. Had the committee gone through the investigation process, they could have made a recommendation to the full House about whether to dismiss the case, hold a new election or seat Hart.,However, many swing-state Democrats were already voicing opposition to voting to overturn an election if that recommendation was made. With tight margins currently in the House, it would have been unlikely that Hart would have successfully had the race results reversed.,“There being no contestant, there is no longer a contest, and the Committee will, accordingly, recommend that the whole House dispose of the contest and adopt a dismissal resolution reported out by the Committee,” Administration Chairwoman Zoe Lofgren said in a statement.,

https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/03/31/actually-data-dont-suggest-anything-unusual-about-floridas-excess-death-toll/,"Actually, the data don’t suggest anything unusual about Florida’s excess death toll","For months, critics of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) have suggested that his administration is underreporting the effects of the , pandemic in his state. The high-profile firing of (and subsequent ,) Florida’s top data scientist contributed to such questions. Shortly before the 2020 election — in which DeSantis’s political ally, President Donald Trump, was being judged in part on his pandemic response — the state’s reported death numbers ,.,DeSantis’s habit of leaning into criticism from his political opponents has heightened scrutiny of how the pandemic is unfolding in his state. But, overall, the numbers from Florida , from other places, muddying efforts to cast DeSantis as incompetent or nefarious.,Given all of that, it’s not surprising that , from Yahoo News alleging that the number of deaths reported in the state was undercounted was embraced by the governor’s critics. Former governor (and former Republican) Charlie Crist, who’s exploring a run for his old job, , on Twitter that DeSantis “was likely hiding thousands of positive COVID cases,” linking to the article.,The Yahoo report points to research , in the American Journal of Public Health earlier this month that suggests that the “impact of COVID-19” — the disease caused by the coronavirus — “on mortality is significantly greater than the official COVID-19 data suggest.” That assessment derives from analysis of Florida’s excess-death count, the number of deaths recorded in the state that exceeded recent annual averages. Imagine if Florida had seen 1,000 deaths on average in the first week of January in 2017 through 2020. Then, in 2021, the number of deaths jumped to 1,250. That shift, those excess deaths, would suggest that something unusual happened.,Dropped into a political debate, that conclusion seems to support the argument that Crist makes: DeSantis is hiding the true death toll.,Considered in the broader context of the national pandemic, as it should be, it doesn’t.,There is no real question that the number of deaths from covid-19 recorded in the United States is too low. In an interview last May, the country’s top infectious-disease expert, Anthony S. Fauci, , in a television interview. For a variety of reasons including the slow rollout of tests for the virus, the count of confirmed deaths is likely smaller than the number of actual deaths, as suggested by excess-death data compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.,The CDC , excess-death data derived from death certificates. The data are usually a few weeks out of date, given that death certificates take a while to be produced and transmitted to the organization. But even so, one can see how excess deaths over the past year have mirrored the coronavirus pandemic.,Below are graphs showing the recorded excess death counts nationally and in several states as a function of the expected average toll in a given week. You can see the three waves nationally that occurred last spring, over the summer and in the fall and winter. Those waves hit different places at different times, with New York hit hard in the first wave but not the second and the opposite pattern occurring in Florida.,There are some remarkable spikes shown in that data, like the one in South Dakota that preceded (and contributed to) the third national wave. What doesn’t stand out is Florida’s excess death toll, particularly when compared to Georgia, its immediate neighbor to the north.,Of course, that doesn’t tell us anything about the comparison between Florida’s official covid-19 death toll and its excess deaths, just that the excess deaths themselves don’t suggest any strange pattern.,So let’s address the question directly. The CDC data include weekly estimates of excess deaths within an estimated range that we can use to show a broad estimate of the number of excess deaths in a region over time. When compared to the official death toll compiled by The Washington Post, you can see that nationally and in New York and Florida, the number of excess deaths has generally run ahead of the number of confirmed deaths. In recent weeks, the number of confirmed deaths has closed with or caught up to the number of excess deaths — because those excess deaths are compiled on the aforementioned delay.,The gap between confirmed covid-19 deaths and excess deaths is not entirely or necessarily a measure of undetected covid deaths. It could also be other deaths that occurred because of the pandemic, like someone avoiding the emergency room out of concern of catching the virus who then dies of a heart attack. What’s noticeable about that lower graph, though, is that Florida’s confirmed death toll runs a lot closer to the excess toll than does New York’s, perhaps in part because New York’s first surge overlapped with a period when testing wasn’t expansive.,All of this aside, you don’t need to rely upon our analysis of the CDC data to lose confidence in the thesis of the Yahoo report. You can, instead, rely upon the assessment of Moosa Tatar, the lead researcher on the study Yahoo cites.,“The impact of COVID-19 on mortality is significantly greater than the official COVID-19 data suggest,” he , National Review in an interview. “But we need further research to determine specific reasons for this. These deaths may have been directly or indirectly associated with COVID-19.”,Or you can listen to Lauren Rossen, who assesses excess-death data for the CDC.,“Florida doesn’t stand out to me,” she said — to Yahoo News.",politics
https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/03/31/bogus-claim-that-democrats-seek-register-illegal-aliens-vote/,The bogus claim that Democrats seek to register ‘illegal aliens’ to vote,"Heritage Action for America, a conservative group affiliated with the Heritage Foundation, is , on television ads in Arizona targeted at convincing two Democratic senators — Kyrsten Sinema and Mark Kelly — to vote against an elections bill called S.B. 1.,A virtually similar bill, H.R. 1, has already passed the House of Representatives on ,. The bill, among its provisions, would create uniform national voting standards, overhaul campaign finance laws and outlaw partisan redistricting.,Both senators are co-sponsors of the companion Senate legislation, so the odds are slim that the ad will have an effect. (The ad also looks like it was produced with a minimal budget.) But perhaps it might convince voters that the Democrats are supporting what the ad calls a “partisan power grab.”,A number of statements are made in the ad, but for the purposes of this fact check, we are going on focus on the ad’s claim that the bill is designed to allow undocumented immigrants to vote — a charge that would have particular resonance in a border state.,The ,, commonly known as the “motor voter law,” made it possible for state motor vehicle agencies and social-service agencies to register voters. The proposed law would implement what is known as Automatic Voter Registration (AVR) at motor-vehicle agencies, government agencies and public universities.,Noah Weinrich, press secretary for Heritage Action, cited , issued by the Heritage Foundation concerning H.R.1. The report claimed that the bill’s requirement that states automatically register individuals from state and federal databases, such as state Departments of Motor Vehicles, “would register large numbers of ineligible voters, including aliens.”,Weinrich also cited , by Hans von Spakovsky, a Heritage senior legal fellow, that criticized as “biased” a CNN fact check of former vice president Mike Pence attacking the bill.,“The complex sections of HR 1 on automatic voter registration require numerous state and federal agencies to send information on individuals to state election officials so they can be registered,” Spakovsky wrote. “Many state and federal agencies don’t have citizenship data on the individuals they deal with.” He added that “HR 1 specifically states that no alien can be ‘prosecuted under any federal or state law’ or ‘adversely affected in any civil adjudication concerning immigration status or naturalization’ due to being automatically registered.”,While Heritage makes this sound nefarious, as of February, automatic voter registration has already been enacted in 19 states and the District of Columbia, so over a third of Americans live in jurisdictions that have either passed or implemented AVR, ,. In this legislative cycle, 39 states have introduced legislation to implement or expand automatic registration.,“AVR makes voter registration ‘opt-out’ instead of ‘opt-in’ — eligible citizens who interact with government agencies are registered to vote or have their existing registration information updated, unless they affirmatively decline. Again, the voter can opt-out; it is not compulsory registration,” a Brennan Center report says. “Second, those agencies transfer voter registration information electronically to election officials instead of using paper registration forms. These common-sense reforms increase registration rates, clean up the voter rolls, and save states money.”,As an example of the potential pitfalls of AVR, Weinrich pointed to , when it implemented an AVR program through the Department of Motor Vehicles, resulting in thousands of erroneous registrations, including at least one involving a noncitizen. It turned out there was a programming flaw that caused the system to mix up records, officials said at the time. The registrations were canceled and any vote-by-mail ballots, if issued, were suspended. The computer glitch was quickly detected, contained and corrected.,Since 2018, ,, California has registered 2.2 million new voters through the DMV and re-registered 4.8 million voters — and more than 7 million Californians have opted out of voter registration.,“It’s remarkable how few of the states that have AVR actually experienced these types of glitches,” said ,, who directs Brennan’s Democracy Program.,In any case, registration of an ineligible voter is already a federal crime, punishable by up to five years in prison (,). It is also unlawful for any alien to vote in any election held solely or in part for the purpose of electing a candidate in federal office (,).,Peter Whippy, communications director for the House Administration Committee, pointed to several items in H.R. 1’s , that provide safeguards to ensure ineligible people are not registered to vote. H.R. 1 requires every state to implement an automatic voter registration system, but the bill continually makes it clear that only citizens are eligible to be registered. H.R. 1 also requires eligible voters to affirm that they are U.S. citizens before they are added to the voter rolls.,As for the provision cited by von Spakovsky, Whippy said that is intended to provide “a safe harbor for any immigrants inadvertently being added to the voter rolls due to a similar state error and avoid potential deportation or adverse legal action through no fault of their own.”,Weiser said that in the states that have implemented AVR, it had proved to be more reliable and error-free than relying on people’s own assertions that they are eligible to vote. That’s because agencies often already have information on whether a person is eligible to vote, she said.,In this ad, Heritage Action has taken a somewhat remote possibility that undocumented immigrants would be registered as voters under AVR and turned it into a Democrat desire — that they “want to register illegal aliens.”,First of all, it’s against the law for noncitizens to vote. Second, the proposed law contains numerous safeguards to prevent that from happening — safeguards that would not be in place if Democrats really planned to enlist noncitizens as voters.,Heritage Action can point to only one example when an AVR system inadvertently signed up people not eligible to vote — a computer glitch in 2018 that was quickly discovered and corrected, with the registrations canceled. Since then, no other such problems have emerged in California.,If Heritage had made the case that undocumented immigrants might inadvertently be registered, despite the proposed safeguards, this might have been a Three Pinocchio claim. Errors are always possible with new systems. But claiming, without evidence, that Democrats want to enlist illegal voters tips this claim to Four Pinocchios.,(,)",politics

He was 84.,The cause was complications from an infection, said his friend Justin Zaremby.,Laconic and soft-spoken, Mr. Hill spent nearly his entire government career working behind the scenes, avoiding photo ops while serving as a speechwriter and aide to secretaries of state Henry Kissinger and ,. He was later a policy consultant to ,, the secretary general of the United Nations, during a tumultuous period in the 1990s that included the breakup of Yugoslavia, genocide in Rwanda and civil war in Somalia.,“Attention isn’t something that’s very interesting to me. It seems to use a lot of time that could be spent on something else,” he told the Hartford Courant ,. “Ronald Reagan had a plaque on his desk which read, ‘There’s no limit to what you accomplish, as long as you don’t care who gets the credit.’ ”,A self-described “Edmund Burke conservative,” Mr. Hill championed what he described as the liberal world order, arguing in recent years that Islamism posed a global threat and that the United States “has to stand for democracy.” In 2008, he served as the chief foreign policy adviser for former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani’s presidential campaign.,Mr. Hill started out in the Foreign Service, with postings in Europe, East Asia and South Vietnam, where he was a speechwriter for ,. He later advised Bunker on the Panama Canal treaty negotiations and, in 1974, began working for Kissinger as a speechwriter.,“He reviewed almost everything I wrote,” the former secretary of state said in a phone interview. “What made him effective was his thoughtfulness, his unselfishness, his dedication to ideas, his understanding of human beings.” Mr. Hill, he added, possessed an “acute judgment” on issues ranging from the evolution of China to the Arab-Israeli conflict, which he increasingly focused on during the Carter administration.,Mr. Hill served as political counselor for the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv, director of Arab-Israeli affairs and deputy assistant secretary of state for the Middle East. In 1985, he was named executive aide to Shultz, a post that made him chief of staff to Reagan’s top diplomat during a period that included nuclear-weapons negotiations with the Soviet Union and efforts to , with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.,In part, “his influence lay in his quite extraordinary, relentless note-taking,” said his former student ,, author of “The Man on Whom Nothing Was Lost,” a 2006 biography of Mr. Hill. He produced about 20,000 pages of notes — chronicling everything from a religious ceremony in Fiji to comments that Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev’s wife, Raisa, made at dinner — resulting in documents that shaped policy discussions.,“I don’t think there was anyone that Shultz trusted more,” Worthen said.,Mr. Hill’s note-taking drew national attention in the wake of a scandal known as Iran-contra, in which the Reagan administration secretly sold weapons to Iran in an effort to win the release of American hostages in Lebanon. Profits were diverted to fund right-wing Nicaraguan rebels known as the contras, in violation of congressional restrictions on such aid. Shultz, who died in February, was one of the few senior members of the administration to emerge unscathed.,Mr. Hill’s notes helped guide the Iran-contra special prosecutor, ,, leading to the discovery of additional notes from Defense Secretary ,, who was indicted and later pardoned by President ,. Together, the two officials’ notes constituted “an extraordinary record of administration plotting, agonizing and infighting,” according to a 1993 Washington Post ,.,After Bush took office, Mr. Hill resigned from the Foreign Service and helped Shultz write his 1993 memoir, “Turmoil and Triumph.” Three years later he began teaching full-time at Yale, ranging across traditional disciplinary boundaries while leading seminars on Aristotelian statecraft, political oratory and Tibetan civilization, among other subjects.,He was best known for Studies in Grand Strategy, a year-long course that he created in 2000 with historians John Lewis Gaddis and Paul Kennedy. Loosely modeled after a class at the Naval War College in Rhode Island, the course examined large-scale issues of statecraft and social change while drawing on classic works of history and literature.,“The international world of states and their modern system is a literary realm; it is where the greatest issues of the human condition are played out,” he wrote in a 2010 book, “Grand Strategies,” which examined the development of the modern state with help from works by Homer, Thucydides, Franz Kafka and Salman Rushdie.,Mr. Hill came to embody the Grand Strategy course, which was credited with inspiring similar classes at schools including Duke and the University of Texas. Addressing students by their last name, holding open-door office hours each week, he developed a devoted following among undergraduates, even as liberals on campus joked that his class should be called “Grand Fascism.”,“Charlie’s criticism of the Clinton administration was always that it was a bunch of very, very smart wonks who can’t see the forest for the trees,” Worthen said. Mr. Hill and his colleagues “were reasserting the need to talk about giant ideas and not simply make foreign affairs a matter for the technocrats,” she added. “And then 9/11 happened. I was an undergraduate then, and we were so hungry for someone to explain it to us.”,Morton Charles Hill was born in Bridgeton, N.J., on April 28, 1936. His father was a dentist, his mother a homemaker.,He received a bachelor’s degree from Brown University in 1957 and studied at the University of Pennsylvania, where he graduated from law school in 1960 and earned a master’s degree in American studies in 1961, shortly before joining the Foreign Service.,Mr. Hill was later a research fellow at the Hoover Institution, a conservative public policy think tank at Stanford University.,His marriage to Martha Mitchell (unrelated to the Watergate-era political figure) ended in divorce, and in 1992 he married Norma Thompson and joined her part-time at Yale, where she was a political science professor.,In addition to his wife, of New Haven, survivors include a daughter from his first marriage, Catharine L. Smith of Washington; and two grandchildren. Another daughter from his first marriage, Emily C. Hill Van Lieu, died in 2013.,In an interview, his colleague Gaddis said that Mr. Hill focused on literature even more than his Grand Strategy partners, believing that great books offered “a kind of inner vision of how people’s emotions or minds are working.”,“Yale administrators didn’t know what to do with him, where to put him,” he added. “He existed outside of departmental structures. More significantly, he existed outside of specialties. I would say his specialty was finding linkages between specialties. It’s the opposite of siloing, looking for connections across disciplinary boundaries. And of course, there is almost nobody else around at Yale who does that now.”,

https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/03/31/biden-pittsburgh-infrastructure/,"With political future at stake, Biden returns to Pa. to rally voters around economic agenda","Weeks before he won the White House, then-candidate Joe Biden hopped off a train at an Amtrak station in Pittsburgh and , a throng of supporters to “build our country and our economy back better than it was before.”,Now, as president, he’s set to return to the Steel City on Wednesday, this time to rally Pennsylvania voters around a roughly $2 trillion blueprint for bringing that pledge to life.,The rollout of Biden’s , in Pittsburgh marks only his latest overture to Rust Belt battlegrounds that Democrats increasingly see as critical to enacting their economic agenda nationwide. Party leaders have been aggressive about promoting their vision for bigger government, and higher spending, since securing $1,400 checks as part of a , in early March. But they’ve taken that message directly and repeatedly to Pennsylvania, sensing the high stakes in proving to swing-state voters they are able to keep their word.,“Biden doesn’t have any room to stumble here, in the sense that the country needs this so desperately and can’t suffer another promise by more politicians that don’t deliver,” said Tom Conway, president of the United Steelworkers, who will join Biden this week.,Biden’s courtship of Pennsylvania traces back to the 2020 race: He started and ended his campaign in Pittsburgh and visited the state more than any other candidate — 19 times in five months — to sap its coveted electoral votes from President Donald Trump. Biden then returned to the state earlier this month to tout the American Rescue Plan, a , stimulus package,that counts among his first achievements and one of the largest economic rescue measures in history.,With infrastructure, Democrats say another legislative victory will provide a powerful local jolt, delivering jobs and other economic opportunities to steel and manufacturing hubs in Pennsylvania, benefiting its many union workers. Party leaders recognize the package would be a boon to their own prospects, as well, with an open Senate seat — and the fate of the party’s control of the chamber — hanging in the balance in 2022.,“I think what we have to do is not be full of crap,” said state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta, a former surrogate for Biden on the campaign trail who is now running for U.S. Senate. “We have to actually have deliverables and plans on how we are going to position Pennsylvania and this country not to get back to where we were, but to build back better in the way that the president campaigned on.”,But Democrats face a daunting political challenge in overcoming voters’ lingering apprehension about excess federal spending and the tax increases on rich families and corporations that may be required to finance it. Republicans have seized on the size and scope of Biden’s economic proposals to launch attacks that have resonated with some voters in Pennsylvania, perhaps offering a glimpse of the tough messaging war to come.,In Erie, Pa., Mike Martucci perused the olive and pickle aisle at a supermarket Sunday, clad in an all-black Titleist hat and matching mask. A self-described patriotic conservative, he expressed deep reservations with Democrats’ stimulus law, echoing Republicans who charged that too few of the dollars went toward actual coronavirus relief.,But Martucci, 53, struck a more undecided note on infrastructure, torn between agreeing with Biden about the need for repair and distrusting Democrats and the ideas they have put forward.,“It’s needed badly,” he said. “I get that, to stay competitive as a country.”,The White House declined to comment.,The plan that Biden is expected to unveil Wednesday tracks largely with the proposal he put forward during his campaign, when the “son of Scranton” first traveled to next-door Dunmore, Pa., to debut the first pillar of a five-part agenda that became known as “Build Back Better.”,The , nearly a decade of new federal spending to upgrade the country’s roads and bridges, repave highways and replace water pipes, and invest heavily in new technology to combat climate change and improve Internet access nationwide. It is the first of two proposals from Biden, with the second coming in April, totaling perhaps $4 trillion and targeting broad swaths of the economy.,In doing so, Biden seeks to finance the full effort through raising taxes on high-income families and profitable corporations. His plan largely relies on repealing some of the tax cuts adopted under Trump, in keeping with Democrats’ campaign pledge to unwind the 2017 law while sparing Americans who make under $400,000 from paying higher rates. While Biden has expressed an openness to negotiating these tax increases with Republicans, Democrats have signaled they are ready to move forward in the absence of GOP support.,“We’re currently 13th in the world; no one believes we should be there,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday when asked about the need for an infrastructure package. “And he has a plan to pay for it, which he will propose.”,Entering the legislative battle, Democrats have carried an air of political confidence after securing passage of the $1.9 trillion stimulus. Not one Republican voted in support of the plan in a blow to Biden’s early commitment to bipartisanship, but Democratic leaders insist the relief — and their broader agenda — remains widely popular among voters across the political spectrum.,Their contention is likely to be put to the test in the coming months in states including Pennsylvania, where one of two Senate seats is up for grabs next year with the looming retirement of Republican Sen. Patrick J. Toomey. Because Democrats possess the smallest possible Senate majority, the election may serve as the ultimate gauge of Biden’s economic agenda — a realization that has sparked an all-out blitz by party lawmakers to sway Rust Belt voters early.,“That’s going to be determined by the work that I and others do to make sure the people know what’s at stake for the country in terms of the economy and what our party has tried to do to help them,” said Sen. Robert P. Casey Jr. (D-Pa.). “We have to make sure they know not only what is the nature of that help and the scope of it … [but] that there is a basic difference here between the parties.”,Ahead of Biden’s speech, Democrats have sought to position the burst of federal spending as a major coup for Pennsylvania, particularly in the manufacturing, natural gas and steel industries. Democrats also see their proposal as an opportunity to bring about a new generation of economic growth and job creation by investing in sustainable energy manufacturing while tackling more local safety concerns.,“People are very conscious of how many bridges are not up to par in Pennsylvania, and it makes us wonder, ‘Am I the last one over to make it safely?,’ ” said Rep. Matthew Cartwright (D), whose eastern Pennsylvania district is considered one of the most competitive entering the next election.,Republicans have mobilized in opposition, questioning the scope of the infrastructure overhaul that Democrats seek and their preferred way to pay for it.,“Between the $1.9 trillion that was completely unnecessary and wildly excessive to now another who-knows-how-many-more trillions, it is really a massive, massive expansion of the size and scope of the federal government,” said Toomey, who helped broker the tax law.,Despite the Democrats’ success in 2020, , showed that Pennsylvania voters who were most worried about the economy largely broke in Trump’s direction, offering the GOP a potential avenue for attack.,But the Trump administration long faced broad criticism for not being able to deliver an infrastructure proposal, much less a package, despite many promises to do so. Some state Democrats now contend it is the GOP that faces the greatest political risk if lawmakers in Congress who say they support such spending can’t strike a deal.,“Infrastructure sort of became a running joke,” said Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, one of the Democratic candidates for Senate. “Just because it became a cliche doesn’t make it any less true ... It’s going to be a revolution for the union way of life.”,But the verdict may well rest in the hands of counties like Erie, a politically deadlocked expanse in the northwest corner of Pennsylvania where unemployment remains high — and voters remain torn.,As she browsed the citrus section at Walmart on Sunday, Patricia Steele, a nurse, said she was happy to see the stimulus bill pass and knows it is helping people in Erie pay their rent and bills.,She supports the infrastructure bill, particularly the push to move toward clean energy. But the 59-year-old Democrat said she has little hope that it will do much to change the face of Erie’s economic issues especially if contractors from outside of Pennsylvania ultimately end up doing all the work.,“Our people still aren’t going to get the jobs,” Steele said.,Just beyond the city line, parishioners were chatting at the Grace of Calvary Baptist Church shortly after Sunday service. David Richardson, a 71-year-old who said he votes Republican for president, lamented that it took so long for Congress to authorize stimulus aid — and questioned whether the infrastructure bill would deliver “pork” or the economic benefits that Biden had touted.,If people in Erie did get good jobs out of the spending, though, Richardson said he would be glad to see it — harking back to the federally funded projects that helped the economy rebound after the Great Depression.,“They had to do something to put people to work, to help to pay the bills,” he said. “That kind of stuff is good.”",politics

The rescue plan — which provides money for vaccines and $1,400 stimulus payments to many Americans — remains popular among a majority of Americans, according to polling. But it could complicate Biden’s appeal to the American people to support another high-dollar package in such short order — especially one that costs even more, will require tax hikes to pay for it and will promise results that are less immediate.,If successful, Biden’s package would mark  the largest spending bill in sheer dollars in the nation’s history. But as a percentage of gross domestic product on a yearly basis, the overall 10-year package is actually much smaller than other major economic packages, including the most recent stimulus package, according to Richard Kogan, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.,Biden allies and advisers argue that the infrastructure proposal represents the policies and promises that the president campaigned on and that it will prove popular with the public, if not necessarily Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill. They say the lessons they learned from the coronavirus relief package — as well as President Barack Obama’s mixed success in selling his 2009 stimulus bill — is that the real risk is not being sufficiently ambitious.,But they are also prepared for a more complicated legislative process than they faced with the relief bill, with more negotiation and attempted compromise with their Republican counterparts.,White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Biden’s speech Wednesday will lay out his vision for fixing the nation’s infrastructure challenges, which she characterized as something the entire country should be able to agree on.,“Fundamentally, we don’t believe that making a historic investment in American workers and rebuilding our infrastructure across the country to help us compete with China is controversial,” Psaki said. “And while the president will lay out a plan for paying for it over time, we’re also open to having a discussion about alternatives.”,Republicans, who have so far struggled to effectively undercut Biden’s early moves on the pandemic and vaccines, are hoping the infrastructure package gives them a new attack line against Democrats as they head into the midterms. They are especially optimistic that they can use the expected tax increases  as well as the Democratic priorities in the legislation — such as an expected $400 billion in clean-energy credits and another $400 billion toward care for the elderly and people with disabilities — to paint the Democrats as out of touch and hostage to their liberal base.,Speaking on the Senate floor Monday, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said he expected the infrastructure bill to be “a Trojan horse for massive tax hikes and other job-killing left-wing policies.”,Chris Hartline, spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said Republicans see a political opportunity in the legislation because of its cost and its reach beyond building roads and bridges.,“It’s one thing to do a big spending bill on covid,” Hartline said. “The public’s view on this will be different for a bill this big that is not directly related to covid and, to be honest, a bill that’s not directly related to infrastructure.”,The administration’s plan to pay for the package, including through taxes on high-income individuals and companies, is likely to negatively impact even everyday Americans, Hartline said. “I don’t see how this doesn’t include taxes for small busi­nesses, workers — all the people Joe Biden said he’d never raise taxes on,” he said.,During the campaign, Biden vowed that Americans making less than $400,000 a year would not pay higher taxes, a stance he has reaffirmed since taking office. But the White House has already found itself grappling with the potential land mines in discussing raising taxes, after ,Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg had to quickly walk back comments last week he made about a potential mileage tax or higher gas taxes.,White House officials are signaling to allies on Capitol Hill that they want to take a substantively different approach to the legislative process than they did when they jammed through the stimulus package earlier this month. They are, gearing up for more negotiations and potentially significant changes to the bill, and say they will be more open to input and alternative proposals from members of Congress in both parties.,A White House aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the administration’s thinking, said the administration wants Congress to make progress on the legislation before  Memorial Day and will consider breaking the legislation up into more parts if necessary.,Jonathan Alter, the author of “The Defining Moment” — a book about President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s first 100 days in office that Biden and some members of his team have read — said the backdrop of crises could help Biden extend his ability to pass bold Democratic prescriptions on a range of issues.,“When there’s a crisis, all this talk about small government and ‘Get the government out of my pocket’ goes away, and people need the government to stay afloat,” Alter said. ,The results, not the process or price tag, is what ultimately matters, he said. When Roosevelt was once asked about the political philosophy behind the Tennessee Valley Authority — an immense public power project that he signed into law — Alter summarized the former president as quipping, “It’s neither fish nor fowl, but it sure does taste good to the people of the Tennessee Valley.”,Republicans, however, are skeptical of the administration’s promises that this legislation will be more collaborative. Several have pointed to the relief package, saying the White House merely feigned interest at bipartisanship before steamrolling Republicans and pushing through their original proposal, largely unchanged.,“There isn’t a Republican in Washington holding his or her breath,” said one Senate Republican aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to candidly discuss the process. “Democrats showed us their playbook on their so-called covid-relief package: Take an issue with bipartisan support, stuff it full of trillions of dollars’ worth of unrelated far-left priorities, and then jam it through on a party-line vote. We were paying attention. Regardless of what they call it, that isn’t negotiating. And it isn’t bipartisan.”,Democrats are also seeking to avoid a situation like in 2009, when Republicans pounced on the Obama administration for alleged wasteful spending in the administration’s stimulus package. In one example, Solyndra, a clean-energy company, misled the federal government to obtain millions of dollars in loans and then filed for bankruptcy.,Democrats say the Biden administration will also need to be careful to explain the details of the new package, especially as Americans will not see the immediate effects of the spending as they did when stimulus payments hit their bank accounts. Many Democratic lawmakers in swing districts or purple states say they are willing to support the large price tag — but only if the final package reflects critical infrastructure projects rather than what they view as auxiliary Democratic goals, such as efforts aimed at mitigating climate change.,John Anzalone, Biden’s top pollster on the campaign, said the president’s high approval ratings on the coronavirus relief package should buoy Democrats in their efforts to pass another expansive package, especially one in which Biden will clearly outline how he will pay for much of the spending.,Anzalone also brushed aside criticism from Republicans about the federal debt or raising taxes, saying the party approved freewheeling spending under past Republican administrations and pointed to polling showing that most Americans think the wealthy and corporations should pay more.,“The American people feel they get screwed constantly and they’re the target of taxes, and they believe the wealthy and big corporations should pay their fair share,” Anzalone said.,House Majority Whip James E. Clyburn (D-S.C.), a close Biden ally, said the massive price tag on Biden’s proposal simply reflects the severity of the nation’s crumbling infrastructure and the need for historic investment.,“I don’t know why people think you’re going to get broadband into American homes by clipping coupons from the Sunday papers,” he said. “That’s not going to happen. You’re not going to fix the roads and bridges that we all know need to be fixed in this country by praying about it. You got to spend the money.”,Clyburn said he is confident that Democrats will fall in line behind tax increases on the rich despite early warnings from some moderates. Democratic Reps. Bill Pascrell Jr. (N.J.), Josh Gottheimer (N.J.), Mikie Sherrill (N.J.) and Thomas Suozzi (N.Y.), for instance, have said they will oppose any change to the tax code unless Biden lifts a cap implemented by President Donald Trump on the deduction for state and local taxes. Democrats’ slim majority in the House — they can only afford three defections — gives them little wiggle room.,“People are already going to grumble about taxes,” Clyburn said. “They are going to grumble no matter what.”,

Gordon Liddy, undercover operative convicted in Watergate scandal, dies at 90","G. Gordon Liddy, the undercover operative whose bungling of the Watergate break-in triggered one of the gravest constitutional crises in American history and led to the resignation of President Richard M. Nixon, died March 30 at his daughter’s home in Fairfax County, Va. He was 90.,His son Thomas P. Liddy confirmed the death but did not give a cause, saying only that it was unrelated to the ,.,A theatrical personality whose event-filled career included more twists and turns than a fictional potboiler, Mr. Liddy was at various times an FBI agent, jailbird, radio talk-show host, best-selling author, candidate for Congress, actor and promoter of gold investments.,The role for which he is best remembered was in the plot to bug the Democratic Party headquarters in the Watergate complex in June 1972.,Mr. Liddy’s combination of can-do ruthlessness, loyalty to Nixon and ends-justify-the-means philosophy made him a natural fit in a White House determined to get even with its political enemies.,At the same time, he was viewed by his superiors as “a little nuts,” in Nixon’s phrase. “I mean, he just isn’t well screwed on, is he?” the president complained to chief of staff , a week after the break-in.,With his intense stare, cannonball head, bristling mustache and machine-gun style of speaking, Mr. Liddy looked like the archetypal bad guys he later depicted in television shows including “Miami Vice.” His friend and fellow Watergate conspirator , described him as “a wired, wisecracking extrovert who seemed as if he might be a candidate for decaffeinated coffee.”,Mr. Liddy often boasted of his transformation “from a puny, fearful boy to a strong, fearless man” through a regime of intense exercise and physical bravado such as eating rats and holding his hand over a candle until the flesh burned.,“The trick is not minding,” he once explained of the pain, echoing a line used by Peter O’Toole in the 1962 movie “Lawrence of Arabia.”,He also developed an early fascination with Nazi Germany, saying that he felt an “electric current” surge through his body when he listened to Adolf Hitler on the radio. To the young Liddy, Hitler embodied the “power of will.”,Although Mr. Liddy frequently boasted of his impeccable tradecraft, he made elementary mistakes that allowed his former FBI colleagues to connect the break-in to the White House and ultimately to a small circle of Nixon aides.,He accepted personal responsibility for the fiasco, declaring that he was “the captain of the ship when she hit the reef.”,“If someone wants to shoot me, just tell me what corner to stand on, and I will be there,” he told presidential counsel John Dean.,Detractors viewed the gun-loving, hippie-hating Liddy as a threat to American democracy and the man responsible for many of the “dirty tricks” of the Nixon administration that led to the resignation of the president on Aug. 9, 1974. Supporters admired his war against “radicals” and “subversives” and his refusal to betray his fellow Watergate conspirators in return for a reduced prison term.,Opinions differ about whether the Watergate scandal would have exploded without Mr. Liddy.,Historian , of the University of Wisconsin described him as a lowly “spear carrier” following the wishes of his commander in chief who will merit no more than a footnote in the history books.,The director of the nonprofit National Security Archive, Tom Blanton, said Mr. Liddy “brought out the worst” in Nixon and his aides, “raising the testosterone level in the White House and ratcheting them up to even more extreme action.”,Desperate to contain the scandal during the run-up to the 1972 election, Nixon’s aides launched a coverup with the personal approval and involvement of the president. Mr. Liddy refused to cooperate with prosecutors and Congress, and was sentenced in March 1973 to a 20-year prison term for conspiracy, burglary and illegal wiretapping. President Jimmy Carter commuted Liddy’s sentence in 1977 and he was released after 52 months behind bars.,By his own account, the Liddy of the Watergate break-in was a product of the culture wars of the 1960s. “The nation was at war not only externally in Vietnam but internally,” he said in his 1980 autobiography “Will,” which sold more than 1 million copies. “I had learned long ago the maxims of Cicero that ‘laws are inoperative in war’ and that ‘the good of the people is the chief law.’ ”,George Gordon Battle Liddy was born in Brooklyn on Nov. 30, 1930, and grew up in Hoboken, N.J. He was named for a prominent lawyer and Tammany Hall leader. His Irish-Italian family raised him as a strict Catholic in parochial schools.,“The nuns introduced me to authority,” he recalled. “First, God. And then: The flag.” The son of a lawyer, he was inspired by the example of his uncle, one of J. Edgar Hoover’s original G-men, who claimed to have been involved in the killing of the gangster John Dillinger.,After graduating from Jesuit-run Fordham University in 1952, Mr. Liddy spent two years in the Army as an artillery officer but was exempted from service in Korea for medical reasons. He returned to Fordham to study law, completed his degree and joined the FBI in 1957.,That same year, he married computer instructor Frances Purcell, whose striking appearance, he wrote in his memoir, reminded him of a “legendary Rhine maiden.”,His wife died in 2010. Survivors include five children and a sister.,Mr. Liddy wrote that he left the FBI in 1962 because he wanted to secure a more comfortable life for his family. According to former FBI officials quoted by journalist and author ,, Mr. Liddy was pushed out because he was a “wild man” and a “super­klutz.”,Leaving the FBI turned out to be a good career move. Mr. Liddy worked several years in patent law with his father’s firm and, in 1965, became an assistant district attorney in Poughkeepsie, N.Y.,He became a local conservative folk hero through his involvement in the 1966 arrest of ,, a former Harvard professor conducting un­or­tho­dox drug research.,Narrowly defeated in a GOP congressional primary, he took charge of the Nixon-Agnew campaign in Dutchess County, N.Y., in 1968 and was rewarded with a post as special assistant to the secretary of the treasury.,Mr. Liddy’s efforts at the Treasury Department fighting drug traffickers put him in touch with White House aide ,, who had set up a special investigations unit nicknamed “the Plumbers” to combat leaks after the unauthorized release of the Pentagon Papers by military analyst Daniel Ellsberg.,In September 1971, Mr. Liddy teamed up with Hunt, a former CIA agent, to hire a group of anti-Castro Cubans to burglarize the Beverly Hills, Calif., office of Ellsberg’s psychiatrist, in the hopes of finding compromising material.,After the Plumbers disbanded, Mr. Liddy was transferred to the Committee to Reelect the President (popularly known as CREEP), to organize intelligence activities against the Democrats.,He proposed a million-dollar sabotage and intelligence plan known as “Gemstone,” which was eventually pared back to a $250,000 scheme that included the bugging of the Democratic headquarters.,He also volunteered to assassinate newspaper columnist Jack Anderson, who he thought was responsible for compromising a top U.S. intelligence source. His superiors vetoed the idea.,Unable to find anyone proficient in bugging, Mr. Liddy recruited the CREEP security chief, ,, whose links to the White House were easily traceable. McCord’s arrest, along with four Cubans, inside the Democratic headquarters shortly after 2 a.m. on June 17, 1972, led to the rapid identification of Mr. Liddy and Hunt.,Mr. Liddy refused to testify before the grand jury investigating Watergate, saying he had not been raised to be “a snitch or a rat.” But his silence failed to prevent the disintegration of the coverup after Nixon’s reelection in November 1972. When McCord began to cooperate with investigators in March 1973, Dean and other Nixon aides concluded that it was every man for himself and negotiated their own immunity deals.,As a federal prisoner, Mr. Liddy relished facing down the wardens and gangs who ruled the penitentiary. In his autobiography, he claimed that he responded to racial epithets from African American prisoners by singing the Nazi “Horst Wessel” anthem that he had learned as a boy, celebrating Aryan superiority.,“I don’t believe there was a man there who understood one word of what I sang,” he wrote. “But they got the message.”,After his release from prison, Mr. Liddy finally broke his silence about his role in Watergate with the publication of “Will,” which was well-received by many of his former antagonists. Washington Post investigative reporter Bob Woodward described the book as the “self-portrait of a zealot,” but he also noted that it contained “an embarrassment of riches” growing out of “his blustery conceit and his freedom from any guilt about what he did. . . . His story rings true,” Woodward wrote in his review.,In an unusual twist, Mr. Liddy teamed up with Leary, his former nemesis, for a series of debates on college campuses. The men were the unlikely co-stars of the 1983 documentary film “Return Engagement,” in which they traded compliments as well as barbs.,Mr. Liddy deplored Leary’s “very dangerous” ideas while praising his “marvelous elfin sense of wit and Irish humor.” Leary depicted Mr. Liddy as “intelligent,” “highly educated” and “deeply idealistic” but attacked him for “turning America into a banana republic.”,“He’s Darth Vader to my Luke Skywalker,” said Leary, who served more than three years for possession of marijuana following the Poughskeepsie drug bust.,Mr. Liddy’s career as a screen villain took off in the early 1980s with the role of the dreaded Capt. William “Mr. Real Estate” Maynard on the NBC police drama “Miami Vice,” which was followed by cameo appearances in other shows. On the old Nashville Network cable channel, he co-starred as a crime boss in the short-lived series “18 Wheels of Justice,” a program that he boasted had “no redeeming social value.”,Success on the lecture circuit led to the “G. Gordon Liddy Show,” a radio talk show that was carried by more than 270 stations across the country and reached an estimated 10 million listeners. He found a wide following for his brand of macho wit.,His standard reply to callers asking how he was doing: “Virile, vigorous and potent.” To those asking for his views on the Second Amendment, he replied: “I believe in gun control. Hold the gun steadily and hit what you aim at.”,In recent years, he hawked the “Stacked and Packed” wall calendar, which he claimed featured “America’s most beautiful women, heavily armed.”,As a felon, Mr. Liddy lost the right to own a gun, but he found an easy way around the law. He told interviewers that he owned no guns, “but Mrs. Liddy owns 27, some of which she keeps on my side of the bed.”,Unlike other Watergate defendants, Mr. Liddy reveled in his celebrity status as the man at the center of a scandal that brought down a president and his reputation for carrying out those dirty tricks. His black Volvo sported the personalized tag H20GATE. He acknowledged that he probably would have ended up as an unsung “Washington political hack moving in and out of power” had it not been for Watergate.,“Things are very, very good for me,” he told the Los Angeles Times in 1991. “I’m very appreciative. I was an accident of history.”,

The final decision on the 2024 nominating schedule is expected to be made in 2022, after Jaime,Harrison,,, seats a rules committee at a national party meeting this fall.,Under a resolution passed last year at,the party’s national convention, the initial review of the nominating process was supposed to be completed by Wednesday, but the party did not act. In a statement,from a spokesperson, the party suggested that more time would “ensure maximum engagement with the public and all stakeholders.”,Larry Cohen, who co-chaired the Unity Reform Commission that helped set the rules for the 2020 cycle and pushed the convention resolution calling for a review, said he wanted to see continued discussion about opening all nomination contests to same-day registration and more public participation, including an absentee-voting process.,Those moves are traditionally controlled by states.,He referenced New York and New Jersey, which limit same-day party registration to vote in primaries.,“It will be late, based on the date and the resolution,” Cohen said of the review. “But it’s much better later and carefully thought out.”,He and others have more recently argued that the 2024 ,nomination plan,has to embody the same principles that Democrats have embraced in general elections, by making voting easier with features such as vote by mail. He has also said he wants to reconsider the nominating calendar and the possibility of consolidating the date early states all vote, an idea sure to be rejected by New Hampshire, where a state law requires that its primary be scheduled a week before any other state’s.,“We take any discussions regarding the presidential nominating process seriously,” New Hampshire Democratic Chairman Raymond Buckley said in a statement. “We will vigilantly monitor any discussions within the DNC and anywhere else.”,Former Senate majority leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) has been leading a charge to switch Nevada’s nominating contest from a caucus to a primary and make it the first in the nation, a direct challenge to New Hampshire. The legislature is expected to take up a bill on the issue in the coming months.,That has set up a fight that will probably force President Biden and the DNC to mediate a resolution. During the 2008 elections, the party set out a nominating calendar that allowed New Hampshire and then South Carolina to be the first two primaries, while giving Iowa and Nevada the first two caucus slots. The party punished states that refused to abide by denying them a full slate of delegates at the nominating convention, setting a precedent that enforced order in the 2012 and 2016 elections.,Harrison, the former South Carolina party chair, said this month that he had not yet spoken to Biden about the nominating calendar, and that he ,.,“We all were very cognizant that this is an ‘every-four-year’ approach, that every four years, the DNC, after an election cycle, will evaluate what the schedule will look like,” Harrison told New Hampshire television station WMUR on March 12. “And we’re going to continue the tradition of doing just that.”,Biden, 78, is the oldest U.S. president ever elected. He has said he plans to run for reelection in 2024, though he has acknowledged that it is possible he will not be a candidate again.,“I’m a great respecter of fate,” he said last week during a news conference. “I’ve never been able to plan 4 1/2, 3 1/2 years ahead for certain.”,

https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/03/30/biden-infrastructure-plan-jobs/,Biden’s infrastructure and climate plan emerges as congressional wrangling begins,"The White House on Wednesday is expected to unveil a plan to spend $2.25 trillion on a jobs and infrastructure package that could form a cornerstone of President Biden’s economic agenda, two people familiar with the matter said.,Biden’s plan will include approximately $650 billion to rebuild the country’s infrastructure, such as its roads, bridges, highways and ports, the people said. The plan will also include in the range of $400 billion toward home care for the elderly and the disabled, $300 billion for housing infrastructure and $300 billion to revive U.S. manufacturing. And it will include hundreds of billions of dollars to bolster the nation’s electric grid, enact nationwide high-speed broadband and revamp the nation’s water systems to ensure clean drinking water, among other major investments, the people said.,The people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to reveal internal deliberations, cautioned that White House officials were still making last-minute adjustments to the plan and that details were subject to change. The roughly $2 trillion in new spending is spread out over eight years, according to the blueprint laid out to congressional allies Tuesday afternoon ahead of the unveiling.,White House press secretary Jen Psaki has said the proposal will be paid for in new tax hikes. These hikes will be particularly focused on corporations, , much of President Donald Trump’s 2017 tax law, the people familiar with the plan said. The new tax hikes would offset spending in the plan over a 15-year period, according to Senate officials familiar with White House calls to brief Congress on Biden’s plan.,The plan will also include approximately $400 billion in clean-energy credits on top of the $2.25 trillion in new spending.,A White House spokesman declined to comment on the new details that have emerged.,The plan, which Biden will introduce in Pittsburgh on Wednesday, forms one part of the “Build Back Better” agenda that the administration aims to introduce. Psaki has said the administration within weeks will introduce a second legislative package. That second package is expected to include an expansion in health insurance coverage, an extension of the expanded child tax benefit, and paid family and medical leave, among other efforts aimed at families, the officials said.,White House officials have not explained whether they will seek to have both efforts pass at the same time or try to get Congress to approve one first. The combined price tag of the plans could top $4 trillion.,The jockeying around these efforts has already begun, as Biden’s allies push for inclusion of their priorities in the next major legislative effort. Centrist Democrats have said the package should be targeted to win Republican votes, seeking a return to bipartisan policymaking after a contentious and partisan vote over Biden’s,. But liberal lawmakers and some economists are pressing the administration to use Democrats’ narrow majorities in Congress to confront some of the nation’s biggest problems, such as climate change, with solutions they say are necessary to address the scale of the crises.,Senior White House officials briefed Senate leadership as well as Democratic and Republican leaders of relevant committees Tuesday afternoon about the details of the plan, according to multiple Senate officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to reveal internal planning.,White House officials Brian Deese, director of the National Economic Council, and chief congressional liaison Louisa Terrell did not lay out a preferred legislative strategy during the briefings with senators, according to those familiar with the calls.,Rather, both Deese and Terrell spoke in broad terms about the president’s infrastructure proposal, emphasizing general principles of the plan rather than drilling down on specific dollar figures, said the people briefed on the calls.,During the calls, Democratic senators such as Patty Murray (Wash.) lobbied administration officials to ensure that provisions such as paid leave and college affordability are addressed in the broader White House plan, although that package won’t come until April.,Congressional aides expect a bruising legislative battle that will prove significantly more difficult than the relatively quick passage of Biden’s relief plan, in which Democrats were held together in part by the need to combat the pandemic. Despite some objections, almost every Democrat in both chambers voted for Biden’s plan.,“I’m getting a little confused about how we’re going to get anything done. It’s only going to get more difficult from here on out,” said Jim Manley, who served as an aide to former Senate majority leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) “There’s not only more divisions over where to go, but there’s a certain sense of spending fatigue setting in on Capitol Hill.”,On Monday, Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) and Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.) unveiled a climate and infrastructure plan that called for $10 trillion in spending over the next decade. Biden’s initial campaign pledge to invest $2 trillion over four years was already inadequate to confronting climate change, and his coming proposal may be even less so, said Robert Pollin, an economist at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, who helped craft the Markey-Dingell plan. Pollin said a $3 trillion investment amounted to only about 1.3 percent of the country’s gross domestic product.,Climate experts have warned the world faces , if it does not reverse global warming.,“That was itself skirting on the edge of being inadequate relative to the climate goals and infrastructure goals,” Pollin said of Biden’s initial plan.,Leah Stokes, an assistant professor of political science at the University of California at Santa Barbara, said in an interview that the amount of money designated for the power sector per reports on Biden’s proposal represents,less than what is,needed to extend renewable energy tax credits and lower consumers’ bills as utilities shift to cleaner energy sources.,“We need more spending on climate change if we want to meet this crisis at the scale that’s necessary,"" Stokes said. “We definitely need more spending on the electricity grid and on rebates for home retrofits for electrification.”,Still, Josh Freed, who runs the climate and energy program at the center-left think tank Third Way, argued in an email that the emerging proposals could still shift the nation’s climate trajectory. He noted that the Energy Department is now spending about $12 billion on energy innovation, so the plan would mark a major boost in that area.,“Our analysis shows that the federal investment could end up being matched by an equal amount of private capital, which would go a long way to getting us to our climate goals,” he said. “This [is] a bold set of investments that does get the grid, homes, and clean energy innovation on track to meet the goal of net-zero by 2050, and it creates a lot of jobs now to put us on the path to a real economic recovery.”,Other challenges to the effort have emerged.,For example, on the campaign trail Biden called for a major investment in home-based care services, aiming to clear massive backlogs in states for disabled and elderly people on Medicaid in need of caretaking assistance. While details on the plan are unclear, some Democrats have called for a much bigger expansion of home care than Biden contemplated as a presidential candidate.,Biden’s team is also eyeing as much as $3 trillion in new tax hikes to pay for the two programs, primarily on wealthy investors, rich people and businesses. Those have already come under heavy criticism from congressional Republicans, who say such hikes will damage U.S. competitiveness and drain the nation of vital economic activity as it struggles to rebound from the pandemic.,Biden’s tax plan is expected to raise the corporate tax rate from 21 percent to 28 percent, end federal subsidies for fossil fuel companies and increase the global minimum tax paid from about 13 percent to 21 percent, as well as other measures aimed at taxing corporations that shelter profits offshore to avoid taxes.,Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said this month that Republicans would not support tax increases to pay for infrastructure. “I don’t think there’s going to be any enthusiasm on our side for a tax increase,"" McConnell ,.,However, some Democrats are already saying they will vote against Biden’s package unless it includes tax changes that Republicans also oppose. Rep. Thomas Suozzi (D-N.Y.) said in a statement Tuesday that he will oppose any deal that does not reverse the limitation on state and local tax deductions imposed by Republicans in their 2017 tax law. That threat could be backed up by other lawmakers in high-tax states who have sought to reverse the GOP provision, although tax experts have said such a change would primarily benefit high-earners.,The White House is pressing forward despite the emerging divisions. “After all the jokes about infrastructure weeks, we’re going to have a real serious effort to get both infrastructure spending on roads and bridges and programs like broadband,” said Howard Gleckman, a tax expert at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center think tank. “I think there’s pretty broad bipartisan support is a big infrastructure plan. There is not bipartisan support for paying for it.”",politics

https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/03/30/trailer-amazon-workers-alabama-just-voted-union-whats-next/,The Trailer: Amazon workers in Alabama just voted on a union. What’s next?,"In this edition: How the Amazon union fight changed politics, new developments in special House races, and why people are talking more about coups.,Little-known fact: Half of the air in Alabama in March is actually pollen. This is The Trailer.,BESSEMER, Ala. — On the last Saturday before the union election at the Amazon fulfillment center, the campaign was already winding down. The tent outside the cavernous warehouse, where a mailbox had been provided for workers coming and going, was empty. Two representatives of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union stood at an intersection, holding signs not far from the police car circling the parking lot. Company signs celebrating Martin Luther King Jr. were planted next to cars, with the words “the dream is alive” slightly larger than Amazon's logo.,“They have a loudspeaker playing rap and R&B music throughout the day,” said Perry Connolly, 58, a worker who voted for the union, speaking of management. “They've got a sign up right now, I guess, for Black History Month. And I hate Black History Month. How are you going to sum up our culture in a month?”,Ballots are being counted in the election, which ended Monday, and results may not be known for days. It's unclear whether a majority of the 5,805 workers , ballots will become the first workers at an American Amazon warehouse to unionize — or if the highest-profile labor battle in years, joined by President Biden and embraced by Democrats, will deliver Southern organizers their highest-profile defeat. The company has urged workers to think about their job security and their paychecks; supporters of the drive have asked them to think not just about better working conditions, but about launching a national movement.,“You may not know it, but what you're doing is historical,” Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said at a small rally outside the RWDSU's nearby Birmingham union hall on Friday. “All over this country, people are sick and tired of being exploited, sick and tired of not having the dignity that they deserve.”,Democrats, from Biden to the local party in Alabama, threw their weight behind a campaign with incredibly steep challenges. The Bessemer facility, in a small and mostly Black city 20 miles from Birmingham, , for less than a year; Darryl Richardson, a “picker” at the warehouse who spends 10-11 hours per day picking up packages from robots, , the RWDSU about conditions there a few months later. In labor terms, the Bessemer facility was a kind of , where some workers began agitating before there was a plan to deal with the inevitable resistance.,(Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.),The New York-based RWDSU had a fairly small presence in Alabama, and less than 10 full-time employees — supplemented by rank-and-file organizers and by other unions led by the AFL-CIO, but still small. Neither the union nor Amazon has revealed their spending on the campaign, but in conversations with workers leaving the plant, many said that they had voted after a company presentation, before getting canvassed by union organizers.,“If they come in and things get better, that's a great thing,” said Ashley Beringer, 32, who had left a food- service job for a $15.25 per hour job at Amazon. An “I VOTED” button, provided after she voted against the union, dangled from her lanyard. “If they don't, time to move on.”,Both Beringer and Connelly are Black, like most of the workers in the warehouse. That was a crucial fact for union organizers. The just-concluded campaign pitched the union drive as an extension of the civil rights movement, a fight for dignity just as vital as the battle to dismantle Jim Crow. The Birmingham chapter of Black Lives Matter threw itself into canvassing; campaigners who arrived to help, such as U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell and anti-poverty campaigner Rev. William Barber, made the linkage explicit.,“Black people have to talk about Black labor and economic injustice,” said Eric Call, the co-founder of the Birmingham BLM chapter. “When you talk about the wealth gap that exists between working-class and rich people, Black people have always been at the bottom. Our involvement is sending a clear message that we're going to be demanding respect.”,The record for that tactic, in recent Southern union drives, is not good. Four years ago, the United Auto Workers tried to organize a Nissan plant in Canton, Miss., with far more prep time than the RWDSU got in Bessemer, and with a similar pitch about the dignity of Black workers. The highest-profile peg of the campaign was , styled after voting rights marches of the 1960s, with the slogan “workers rights = civil rights.” Like the Bessemer organizers, they drew in Sanders, grabbing national attention. They lost decisively, with just 37 percent of workers at the plant signing a union card.,But a Nissan plant is not an Amazon fulfillment center. The Bessemer drive came during a wave of bipartisan criticism of Amazon — Democrats focusing on the grueling working conditions, Republicans more typically focusing on the company's “wokeness.” Bezos, the wealthiest man in the world, had grown wealthier during the pandemic, a point critics on the right and left made to demand changes to his business.,“When the conflict is between working Americans and a company whose leadership has decided to wage culture war against working-class values, the choice is easy — I support the workers,” Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida ,, becoming the highest-profile Republican to actually support the union drive. Local Republican leaders had , the UAW when it tried to organize in Mississippi, and before that, battled the UAW's effort to , a Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga, Tenn. ,There was no such intervention in Bessemer. Meanwhile, organizers and the supporters who came in to help were bringing fresh media attention to the conditions at Amazon warehouses, describing them in piercing terms. “Killer” Mike Render, a rapper and activist who traveled to Birmingham with Sanders, used his conversations with workers and his speech at a public rally to compare what he'd heard to what his grandmother had told him about sharecropping, the post-slavery industry that kept impoverished Black workers on land they did not own.,“I heard about the exact conditions that she described to me when working on a field in Tuskegee, Alabama,” said Render, who accused Bezos of belong to a “planter class” of exploitative bosses. “Unrelenting heat. The inability,to go use the bathroom in and come back and have a full day's work. All these things that a woman who worked in a sharecropping field told me are being said by workers here today.”,The odds of organizing the Bessemer plant were long; like many campaigners nervous about the outcome, organizers this weekend argued that defeat here wouldn't slow them down. In interviews, local RWDSU President Randy Hadley and Alabama Democratic Party Chair Christopher England said that the campaign had brought rare media attention to the workers, and to conditions in the state. Biden's decision to record a supportive video had helped start more conversations with workers; the union was already , the number of workers at other Amazon warehouses who had contacted them about organizing. Whatever happened in Alabama, they had a heterodox political coalition to work with and media interest in hearing from workers.,“That's what it's going to take to get the labor movement back on track, is to get the communities back involved,” Hadley said.,Biden didn't involve himself in the Bessemer fight beyond his first video; a visit by the first lady to Birmingham on Friday, which might have driven more attention, was scrapped due to bad weather. (Jill Biden was not expected to visit the warehouse itself.) But after the votes are counted, labor is expecting more from the president, with the first evidence of how much the White House can help a union drive if it puts a little skin in the game.,“You know, before the Biden video, I was questioning it a bit,” Connolly said. “You know: Are we being greedy? Are we being too sentimental or what? Then when he stepped in and gave his speech and it was like, okay, so this isn't just us. We do have a legitimate gripe and we need things to be better.”,No “key race alerts” or theme music for this one.,How one state's election system is built for angry elections.,The saga of Big Dan Rodimer.,“,”,Big money and a fight for self-preservation.,Democrats go back to the future.,Wait for a gerrymander or try for a six-year term?,The campaign for , is almost over, with Democrats voting today on their nominee for the Albuquerque-area seat vacated by Interior Secretary Deb Haaland — three days after Republicans nominated state Sen. Mark Moores.,Ballots in the Democrats' all-email election went out this morning, and results will be ,, no later than 9 p.m. in Albuquerque. If no Democrat secures a majority of the vote, the top two candidates will compete again tomorrow. Five of the eight candidates vying for the nomination are Hispanic, two are White, and one, state Rep. Georgene Louis, would be the first Native American to replace a fellow Native American in Congress. There's little separation on the issues between the best-known candidates, which includes Sen. Antoinette Sedillo Lopez, who ran for the seat three years ago. ,But in the vote's final hours, Latino groups warned that the seat would be harder to defend without a Latino candidate.,“The district is majority Latino & the GOP nominee is Latino,” , the executive director of the Latino Victory Fund. “We need to ensure the Dem nominee reflects the community. We have some strong Latino candidates running.”,Republicans initially struggled to find a candidate for the seat, which has drifted left over the years — from a 15.7-point victory for Barack Obama in 2012 to a 22.8-point victory last year for his former vice president. Michelle Garcia Holmes, the GOP's,2020 nominee for the seat, passed on a race; so did Mark Ronchetti, the party's 2020 U.S. Senate nominee. Both had run a few points ahead of Trump, while losing the district by double digits.,That left an opening for Moores, who jumped into the race just 13 days before the nominating convention. He prevailed over radio host Eddy Aragon, one of the first candidates in the ring, by touting his ability to quickly put a campaign together, saying he'd already raised $250,000 — as much as Garcia Holmes had raised during her entire 2020 bid. (Both candidates, like Garcia Holmes, are Hispanic.) After the vote, Moores dodged a question about the 2020 presidential certification (New Mexico Republicans had offered an “alternate” slate of electors, rejecting the official results), and told reporters he'd offer voters a check on Democratic-run Washington.,“New Mexico has really suffered a lot because of the Biden administration ban on oil and gas drilling,” Moores ,. “The radical agenda of the defund-the-police effort has really scared a lot of people, so we’re really going to be talking about that.”,As he echoed the Republican pitch for 2020, there was a challenge for Moores and his party: breaking through in the suburbs. The 1st Congressional District covers part of five counties, anchored by heavily Democratic Bernalillo County, which casts more than 90 percent of the vote. Garcia Holmes triumphed in the four more rural counties by a total 2,196 votes; Haaland romped in Bernalillo County by 54,812 votes. Moores won narrowly last year, even as President Donald Trump lost his northeast Albuquerque district, running 11 points ahead of the former president.,Democrats, despite their gains in the district, remain wary of a potential upset. Just months into Barack Obama's presidency, they lost Albuquerque city hall for the first time in decades, as two squabbling Democrats split the vote and Republican Richard J. Berry became mayor. In 1997, the last time a New Mexican was elevated to the Cabinet, Republicans won the neighboring 3rd Congressional District thanks to a strong Green Party campaign that sapped Democratic votes.,There's no such dissension, yet, and no other liberals on the ballot. Libertarians selected activist Chris Manning as their nominee over the weekend, and former commissioner of public lands Aubrey Dunn, a Republican-turned-Libertarian-turned-independent, is competing for the seat, writing on Facebook this week that “political parties suck.” (MMA trainer Greg Jackson , but opted against it.),In,Baton Rouge activist Gary Chambers came close to an upset this month, winning 21.3 percent of the vote in the all-party primary, far higher than his support in public polls. While most coverage of the race had characterized it as a battle between state Sens. Troy Carter and Karen Carter Peterson, Chambers came close to surpassing Carter Peterson and grabbing a spot in the April 24 runoff.,Chambers officially endorsed Carter Peterson on Monday, releasing a short video decrying the organizations “who said that Gary can't win” before explaining why he was taking sides in the runoff.,“For me to sit out of it — what would be the difference between me and all the national organizations who sat out on us, and we came 1500 votes short?” Chambers ,. “She's not perfect, and she's not me, but she is a progressive fighter who will go to D.C. and champion the issues that are important to us.” ,Among those issues: the Green New Deal, which Carter Peterson supports and Carter does not, citing the potential impact of a fast green energy transition on Louisiana workers.,Approve: 72%,(+4 from early March) ,Disapprove: 28% (-4),Approve: 75%,Disapprove: 25%,Approve: 60%,Disapprove: 38%,Approve: 42%,Disapprove: 57%,Approve: 41%,Disapprove: 57%,The Biden presidency has focused intensely on the ,, shrugging off news cycles about nearly every other topic, including the surge of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border. That has worked so far, in a period when voters tend to be forgiving of a new president. (Before Donald Trump, presidents typically cruised above 50 percent approval in their first 100 days.) But Republicans have the advantage on the issues they've focused most on, especially immigration. Other Ipsos polling has found the ,of that issue far below voter interest in coronavirus recovery — the border has become a top issue for Republicans, but not for independents and Democrats. That arrangement has kept Biden above water, for now.,Already did: 47% (+18 from early March) ,Yes, I will: 42% (-16) ,No: 9% (-2),Already did: 35% (+16) ,Yes, I will: 35% (-9) ,No: 26%,Already did: 33% (+9) ,Yes, I will: 23% (-9) ,No: 36% (-5),In the past few weeks, as the vaccination schedule has ramped up, some Republican-dominated states have made the product more available more quickly for a simple reason: Republicans are least likely to want it. Marist's tracking has found Biden's approval rating hanging steady above 50 percent, and while “immigration” is his weakest issue, it has emerged so quickly that the pollster didn't even ask about it three weeks ago. The trends on vaccination are clearer: Democrats and liberal independents are racing for shots; Republicans are moving more slowly. The highest level of vaccine skepticism comes, not surprisingly, from Trump voters, 40 percent of whom say they won't choose the vaccine. The political mismatch could shape two political dramas: Republican frustration that Trump is not getting credit for the vaccine rollout, and Republican voter anger at the idea of “vaccine passports” that would restrict what vaccine resisters can do., The campaign finance reform-focused Democratic PAC has joined the air war over H.R. 1, the Democrats' For the People Act, responding to GOP-linked advertising in swing states. Ads like this are going up in Arizona, Georgia, Maine, Alaska, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Michigan, New Hampshire and Nevada, a mix of states with Democratic senators who might be less committed to passing the bill by breaking the filibuster and states (chiefly Maine and Alaska) with Republicans who the group believes it can pressure. ,Republican-allied ads have portrayed the bill as a grab for power by Democrats who would allow noncitizens to vote or direct taxpayer money to negative ads. ECU's commercials focus on the bill's “ethics rules” and emphasize “secure” elections. “We need to make sure that they are getting the support and the air cover that they need,” ECU's Tiffany Muller said in an interview, “because we're seeing the Republicans' dark money groups come in and spread misinformation about this bill.”, The former Ohio state treasurer plunged into the 2022 U.S. Senate race in the state as a fighter for Donald Trump, questioning the results of the presidential election. His first paid advertising takes a dramatically softer tone, invoking the Easter holiday to talk about how his Jewish ancestors came to America. “My grandma was saved from the Nazis by a network of courageous Christians who risked their lives to save hers,” Mandel says. “Without their faith, I'm not here today.” ,“, Lynnette Hardaway and Rochelle Richardson are best known as “Diamond and Silk,” a political comedy and commentary team who make fun of liberals and praise Trump. They , at Trump rallies, , — including one where they prayed over the former president — and were , after their coronavirus conspiracy theories nixed their Fox Nation show. ,They also are curious whether there's a way for the president to be overthrown by the military. In a ,on the conservative channel Real America's Voice, the two media personalities speculated that “from a national security standpoint,” Biden and the rest of Democratic leadership could not remain in power.,“Listen, I wish that the military would step in and take over,” Hardaway said. “Larry, Curley, and Moe need go somewhere, sit down, and allow the military to take over from here.” When host David Brody followed up, Hardaway added that the country's elected leadership might need to “to get to the bottom of what the American people saw in the 2020 elections,” and Richardson chimed in to urge “somebody to come in with some common sense and take over.”,It was just one segment, but it wasn't a unique sentiment. Ten weeks into Biden's presidency, the idea that he lacks legitimacy and might well be replaced keeps bubbling up in the outskirts of conservative media. Their deadlines keep changing, but the theme remains the same.,“Donald Trump will be back in office in August,” MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell , hosted by former Trump adviser Steve Bannon, reiterating a theory he shared with Arizona conservatives at a rally this month. “All of the evidence I have, everything that is going to go before the Supreme Court, and the election of 2020 is going bye-bye.”,Both comments were first highlighted by Right Wing Watch, a project of People for the American Way, which notes the most head-turning moments from figures on the right who liberals usually ignore. Neither is realistic. But both “Diamond and Silk” and Lindell were elevated in Republican politics by Trump, and the idea that Biden lacks legitimacy for some reason or another ,., Nick Troiano has been tilting against the two-party system for years, with more disappointments than successes. In 2012, he tried to nominate a moderate presidential candidate on the banner of Americans Elect, a new party that never went anywhere. In 2013, he published a book arguing for a “Centrist Party.” In 2014, he ran for Congress in Pennsylvania as an independent, and lost. ,Since then, through his group Unite America, Troiano has poked around for ways to depolarize politics; his , is getting more states to embrace top-two primaries, pointing out that turnout in at least two states that have them (California and Washington) has been far higher than turnout in states that hold traditional partisan primaries. On Tuesday, Troiano launched a new report on the “primary problem,” arguing that so many districts had been gerrymandered as safely partisan than 83 percent of them were basically decided by a primary.,“I think we'll see more states like Wisconsin where bipartisan legislation was introduced with this concept just last week,” Troiano said in an interview. “A key aspect of this is that we don't need to win this reform every day for it to have a dramatic impact in Congress.”,The momentum for primary changes is inconsistent from state to state. Troiano pointed to Florida, where 57 percent of voters backed a top-two primary measure (all parties compete; the top two head to a general election) in 2020. It wasn't enough to meet the state's 60 percent threshold for passage, but it got more support than any candidate for president had in Florida since the 1980s. At the same time, Louisiana's dominant GOP — they hold every major office except the governor's mansion — is debating , the top-two primary, in part, to make sure conservatives come out on top more frequently. ,That's Troiano's point. Top-two produced Sen. Bill Cassidy, the only Southern Republican who voted to convict Trump in this year's impeachment trial; it is seen as the major reason Sen. Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska,Republican who has drawn a challenger since her own conviction vote, is seen to have a clear path to reelection.,“I think what's interesting about Alaska is that primary reform can reward leaders, rather than punish them, for taking politically courageous stands,” Troiano said. “Sen. Murkowski has shown that she's willing to do that. Our hope is that as nonpartisan primaries may be adopted by other states, they will liberate more leaders from the threat of being primaried from the extremes.”,314 Action Fund, a nonprofit organization founded in 2016 to elect scientists to office.,At the moment,,, a campaign to encourage Amy Acton, Ohio's former director of the state Department of Health, to run for U.S. Senate in 2022. The group has conducted polling to test Acton in a Democratic primary, and to argue that she's the most electable Democrat who might make the race. ,The fund claims to be ready for a $5 million campaign, unusually large for a single PAC in a Senate primary, and 10 percent of what the group says it'll invest in 2020. “With no potential candidate having a significant cash advantage to start the race, 314 Action Fund’s $5 million pledge in the primary positions Amy as the clear front-runner,” the group's spokesman John Sweeney explained in its latest poll announcement, which found Acton viewed far more favorably than Rep. Tim Ryan, a fellow northeast Ohio Democrat.,Democrats have gone nearly winless in Ohio since 2014, with even Sen. Sherrod Brown's 2018 victory revealing losses in traditionally Democratic eastern Ohio. Ryan, who has floated multiple statewide runs but never made one, has won his seat by shrinking margins, and was overly optimistic on Biden's chances in the state — but he has captured more national buzz than Acton, in part because his district might be obliterated by a gerrymander.",politics
https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/03/30/republican-politics-right-wing-media-continue-fuse/,Republican politics and right-wing media continue to fuse,"In June 2015, Fox News quietly , that it was suspending a relationship that was, by then, in its fourth year. A guest who had appeared on the show each week since 2011 would no longer do so, at least for the foreseeable future.,After all, Donald Trump couldn’t both be a Fox News contributor and a candidate for the presidency.,The relationship between the right’s favorite cable news network and the right’s soon-to-be favorite politician was obviously , than it seemed at the time. Trump had reinvented himself as a TV star with “The Apprentice” and had begun to dip his toes into the political world largely by echoing narratives that were popular in right-wing media: questions about Barack Obama’s birthplace, alarmism over the Ebola virus, the dangers of immigration. The Fox News gig established him firmly in both worlds at once.,When Trump announced his candidacy in mid-2015, he did so by elevating things that most Republican politicians wouldn’t say — but that right-wing media personalities couldn’t stop talking about. The Republican establishment tried to maintain a firewall from the rhetoric of the base, out of concern about the electoral repercussions. Trump ripped the firewall apart, bringing along just enough consumers of that rhetoric to squeak into the White House.,What he showed, more than anything, was the value of echoing conservative media’s rhetoric back to its audience. He coddled Fox News hosts and various radio personalities, rewarding them with access that Republicans had previously been far more wary to extend. His administration plucked staffers from conservative media — , — and Fox hired various staffers to fill corporate or on-air positions. The Trump White House was often indistinguishable from Sean Hannity’s show on Fox both in terms of rhetoric and in terms of visible faces. The two had largely fused.,It’s certainly not the case that Trump was the first president, much less the first Republican, to leverage media for political value. What was different about Trump was that he clearly thought that the media standing was at least as important as his political standing, if not more so. It seemed at times as though he had become president to become more famous, not the opposite.,Last fall, voters in North Carolina elected to the House of Representatives one of the youngest people in history. Madison Cawthorn, who turns 26 this year, parlayed a photogenic mug and compelling (if ,) life story into a seat in the U.S. Congress. He, like other Republican freshmen, embraced Trump’s habit of prioritizing attacks on his political opponents over crafting legislative solutions to problems. In an email to his Republican colleagues obtained by ,, Cawthorn was direct: “I have built my staff around comms rather than legislation.”,His focus on Capitol Hill was messaging, not legislating.,To be fair, there’s not much chance for a freshman legislator from the minority party to really shape policy. But it’s rare for a legislator to explicitly prioritize the spotlight of Congress over its constitutional function.,Cawthorn was also simply being frank where others are more subtle. House Republicans such as Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) are far better known for their gimmicks and turns of phrase than they are for their policy positions. A review of Gaetz appearances on Fox News since taking office in 2017 , that he’s appeared on the network for about 46 hours over the past three years.,Over the past 12 months, he’s averaged 87 minutes a month. If each appearance were three minutes long, that would be an average of an appearance a day.,We are therefore not surprised by , on Tuesday that Gaetz is thinking about taking the next step in his career: giving up his House seat for one behind the desk at the conservative network Newsmax. Newsmax emerged as the more Trump-loyal cable network in the wake of the 2020 election, given Fox’s crowd-displeasing decision to adhere to the reality of Trump’s loss. Newsmax’s ratings, almost always well below Fox’s, have , of late, but for a guy with such a robustly demonstrated affinity for television cameras, it’s easy to see why the upstart network holds some appeal. (It’s not clear how Fox News would fill Gaetz’s hour and a half of airtime each month.),We should be clear that Gaetz is not in any danger of losing his House seat. He won reelection in 2018 by 34 points and in 2020 by 30. But if you want to build a national following with a hard-right ideology, it’s harder to do so in politics, where one might have to compromise to earn a majority, than in media, where (as the Atlantic’s James Fallows ,) a large minority is good enough. Trump was an outlier, in that his strategy of simply playing to a fervent minority actually worked.,Well, once.,Again, it is not new that elected officials would move from politics to media and back. What seems unusual at the moment is the extent to which one appears to be almost an extension of the other.,Fox News has allowed sitting officials to host its shows, as it did with , and then-Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi (R) ,. While it used to try to prevent its talent from engaging in explicit politicking, Hannity endorsed Trump in 2016 and later helped fundraise for the Republican Party. Jason Chaffetz (who left Congress to work at Fox) will soon , a Republican fundraiser in Texas, as Media Matters reported Tuesday.,The network continues to serve as employer of choice for Team Trump, announcing a hosting gig for former press secretary , on Tuesday and signing Trump’s daughter-in-law Lara Trump as a contributor earlier this month. Lara Trump and Sarah Sanders — another Fox personality/former press secretary — are reportedly exploring runs for political office; what better place for them to bide their time until doing so than on a Fox News set?,When Lara Trump’s role was announced on “Fox & Friends” on Monday, she said that she sort of felt like she had “been an unofficial member of the team for so long.” Certainly a fair sentiment, and one with which her father-in-law could empathize.,If Lara Trump does decide to run for the Senate in North Carolina, it will be interesting to see if Fox even bothers to kick her off the air.",politics

The bite didn’t break the agent’s skin, and there was no bleeding, according to a White House official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe a sensitive subject.,Major returned to Biden’s home in Delaware for a brief time after the first biting incident, and as his absence was noticed, questions arose about what would become of the German shepherd.,The White House was initially silent on the biting incident but later offered a partial explanation — the equivalent of saying Major was taking time away from official duties to spend time with family.,“With the first lady traveling for three days, Champ and Major went to Delaware to stay with family friends,” LaRosa said then.,A fuller explanation came a short time later, when White House press secretary Jen Psaki was asked about it at a news briefing and responded with what appeared to be a prepared statement, defusing the darkest theories about the pet’s fate.,“Champ and Major, the president and first lady’s dogs, are members of the family and still getting acclimated and accustomed to their new surroundings and new people,” Psaki ,, reading from her notes.,Major, she added, had been “surprised by an unfamiliar person and reacted in a way that resulted in a minor injury to the individual.”,The Bidens , from the Delaware Humane Society. A photo from the society showed the man who would become 46th president of United States holding a leashed puppy in his hand beneath the humane society’s symbol: a human hand reaching out to an animal’s paw. In another picture, Biden showed Major a picture of himself as a younger pup.,Major was one of a half-dozen puppies brought to the rescue agency after they came into contact with something toxic in their home, according to the society. The puppies’ owners couldn’t afford veterinary care and surrendered the animals to the humane society, which posted about the German shepherd.,Biden said in an , earlier this month that Major was receiving more training after the initial biting incident. He chalked up the episode to the dog trying to protect his family and denied that Major had been “banished” to Delaware.,“You turn a corner, and there’s two people you don’t know at all. And [Major] moves to protect,” said Biden. “But he’s a sweet dog. Eighty-five percent of the people there love him. He just — all he does is lick them and wag his tail. But . . . I realize some people, understandably, are afraid of dogs to begin with.”,Champ, the president and first lady’s other German shepherd, is older and so far has not generated any biting-related headlines.",politics
https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/03/31/microsoft-army-augmented-reality/,Microsoft wins $21 billion Army contract for augmented reality headsets,"The U.S. Army has awarded Microsoft a contract worth up to $21 billion for augmented reality headsets that are supposed to help soldiers map the battlefield, select targets and stay aware of possible threats by overlaying intelligence information directly onto their field of vision.,The Integrated Visual Augmentation System, known as IVAS, is part of a broader set of investments meant to make military intelligence data more useful to deployed soldiers, who must quickly make decisions in far-flung battlefields based on the limited information available to them. Many of these so-called “tactical edge” devices build on recent advancements in cloud computing that were developed in the commercial business world.,A ,published by the Army on Wednesday afternoon explained that the IVAS system would help it “achieve overmatch against current and future adversaries.” A separate , published by Microsoft and attributed to Alex Kipman, an augmented reality technologist, said the IVAS program “delivers enhanced situational awareness, enabling information sharing and decision-making in a variety of scenarios.”,Microsoft has been working to develop IVAS for years under an increasingly common , called Other Transaction Authority. These types of contracts allow military agencies to develop and test new technology through a collaborative prototyping process.,The contract award issued Wednesday allows the military to rapidly scale up that prototype for mass production without seeking competing offers. Such arrangements are increasingly favored by military agencies looking to develop and field new technology quickly. They also bypass many of the regulations that typically apply to large government purchases and are less vulnerable to bid protests.,The program could ultimately be worth much less than $21 billion, depending on how many of the headsets and related technology the military eventually orders. It is subject to two five-year increments, meaning the Army could cut the program short if it is unhappy with the product.,Even so, the IVAS award opens up a sizable new line of business for the Redmond, Wash.-based computing giant, which is among several large West Coast tech companies looking to expand their business with the military. In 2019, Microsoft ,its rival Amazon to win the $10 billion contract for the Defense Department’s central cloud computing system, known as JEDI. The JEDI award has been tied up in , ever since.,A handful of tech companies are developing augmented reality technology for consumer scenarios, such as gaming. But Microsoft has focused its augmented reality business squarely on selling to other businesses, some of which will pay several thousand dollars apiece for customized versions of Hololens, the company’s workplace-focused headset.,Over the years it has cut smaller deals with customers such as Japan Airlines to use its Hololens to train pilots and Swiss-based Tetra Pak International to help its representatives remotely repair its packaging machines.,The Pentagon contract represents a new chapter for the company.,“It’s the biggest mixed-reality deal out there,” said Forrester analyst J.P. Gownder. While the military headset differs from the Hololens that’s available to other customers, it’s based the same technology, and uses Microsoft’s Azure cloud-computer services. The size of the deal, and the imprimatur of the Pentagon as a customer, could spark business from other customers.,“It’s going to turbocharge interest,” Gownder said.",business
https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/03/31/georgia-voting-law-companies/,Georgia sports teams and major companies such as Coca-Cola and Delta Air Lines condemn new state voting law,"Some of Georgia’s biggest companies — including Coca-Cola and Delta Air Lines — and Atlanta sports teams the Falcons and the Hawks came out strongly against the state’s new voting law Wednesday amid growing backlash against the business world for failing to do enough to stop the measure from becoming law.,Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian condemned the legislation as “unacceptable” and contrary to the company’s values.,“Last week, the Georgia legislature passed a sweeping voting reform act that could make it harder for many Georgians, particularly those in our Black and Brown communities, to exercise their right to vote,” Bastian said in a Wednesday memo to employees.,“The entire rationale for this bill was based on a lie: that there was widespread voter fraud in Georgia in the 2020 elections. This is simply not true. Unfortunately, that excuse is being used in states across the nation that are attempting to pass similar legislation to restrict voting rights.”,Bastian also said that Delta and other major Atlanta corporations worked with state elected officials from both sides of the aisle to remove some of the “most egregious measures” from an earlier draft of the bill and is working with lawmakers on legislation in the U.S. Congress on legislation that would expand voting rights.,James Quincey, the CEO of Coca-Cola, a Georgia corporate stalwart, said the legislation was “wrong” and “a step backward.” He said on CNBC: “Let me be crystal clear and unequivocal. This legislation is unacceptable. It is a step backward and it does not promote principles we have stood for in Georgia around broad access to voting, around voter convenience, about ensuring election integrity.”,The strong statements Wednesday come after Black Voters Matter, a national community-organizing group that advocates on behalf of Black voters, held demonstrations and called on Delta and Coca-Cola as well as four other Georgia-based companies — UPS, Home Depot, Southern Company and Aflac — to speak out more strongly against the law.,“We had been telling them it was a horrible Jim Crow bill for weeks, and they were just ignoring it,” Cliff Albright, the organization’s co-founder and executive director, said. ""‘Now that you’ve seen the light and now that you agree with us that it’s a horrible bill, you can actually call for them to repeal it.”,A letter signed by 72 Black business executives called on companies to fight similar bills propelled by Republican lawmakers in 43 states after Georgia’s law was passed, the New York Times ,.,And two Atlanta sports teams — the Falcons professional football team and the Hawks basketball team — issued statements about the bill within the past day.,“The right to vote is the most fundamental citizen’s right and we at the Hawks view ourselves as a civic asset — not a partisan organization — and remain committed to endorsing steps that promote equality and encourage participation by all who seek to cast a ballot,” the Falcons principal owner Tony Ressler said in a statement Wednesday.,Atlanta Falcons owner and chairman Arthur Blank said “every voice and every vote matters” in a Tuesday ,.,“The right to vote is simply sacred. We should be working to make voting easier, not harder for every eligible citizen,” Blank said in the release. “Our businesses and family foundation will continue to actively support efforts that advance voting access for the citizens of Georgia and across the nation.”,Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp hit back at Bastian, saying that the airline executive had worked closely with state officials in drafting the law.,“Today’s statement by Delta CEO Ed Bastian stands in stark contrast to our conversations with the company, ignores the content of the new law, and unfortunately continues to spread the same false attacks being repeated by partisan activists,” the governor said in an emailed statement.,Throughout the legislative process, we spoke directly with Delta representatives numerous times. We worked alongside legislative leadership to expand voting opportunities for Georgians, while also taking steps to further secure the ballot box,” Kemp said Wednesday.,“At no point did Delta share any opposition to expanding early voting, strengthening voter ID measures, increasing the use of secure drop boxes statewide, and making it easier for local election officials to administer elections — which is exactly what this bill does.”,A Delta representative declined to comment on Kemp’s response.,The voting measures was signed into law on March 25 after sailing through both chambers of the state’s legislature. Democrats and voting-rights advocates in Georgia see the bill as an act of voter suppression, under the guise of disproved rumors of voter fraud that initially circulated during the 2020 presidential and continued leading up to the highly watched state senate runoffs in January.,Republican lawmakers from dozens of states have attempted to introduce similar legislation, but the SB 202 measure in Georgia is the first to pass. This comes after former president Donald Trump attacked the integrity of the presidential election results in which he lost to President Biden, and after , in December imploring her to uncover “dishonesty” in absentee ballot signatures after alleging without evidence that thousands of ballots were accepted by local election officials in Georgia with forged signatures.,The bill will expand early voting hours, curtail the use of drop boxes for absentee voters, require additional identification for mail-in voting, criminalize third-party groups passing out food and water to voters standing in line outside polling stations, allow electors to challenge the eligibility of an unlimited number of voters and require counties to hold hearings on those challenges within 10 days, block the use of mobile voting vans, and prevents local governments from accepting private sector grants. It would also strip the secretary of state’s voting power as a member of the State Elections Board and give lawmakers the power to start taking over local election boards.,Critics say the bill’s measures would allow for partisan influence on certifying elections or targeting of predominantly Black and Brown voting blocks in heavily Democratic jurisdictions, particularly in Atlanta.,Citi CFO Mark Mason said in a , Wednesday afternoon that he was “appalled” by the bill. Edward Skyler, the company’s head of global public affairs, also addressed voting rights generally in a LinkedIn ,.,“I see it as a disgrace that our country’s efforts to keep Black Americans from engaging fully in our constitutional right to vote continue to this day,” Mason said. “I will join the efforts of many of my fellow Americans in working to ensure other states don’t follow this horrible example. Many heroes have dedicated their lives to fighting for our rights, and we cannot let this type of disenfranchisement go unchallenged.”,Home Depot spokeswoman Sara Gorman pointed to the company’s internal voter education promotion, when asked about SB 202, and said in an email: “We believe that all elections should be accessible, fair and secure and support broad voter participation. We’ll continue to work to ensure our associates, both in Georgia and across the country, have the information and resources to vote.”,Albright said that he would prefer to see Bastian and other corporate leaders testify to legislators that SB 202 will be detrimental to Georgia’s businesses and that their companies don’t support it. He hopes these corporations will rally behind voting-rights advocates’ efforts to push back against similar bills that are up for approval in states like Texas — before they’re passed.,“It’s not enough to just be against voter suppression. You’ve got to be an active advocate for voting rights. Just like it’s not enough to not be racist, you have to be anti-racist,” Albright said. “There’s no balanced approach to human rights.”",business
https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/03/31/unemployment-overpayment-watchdog/,"States have given out billions in unemployment benefit overpayments during pandemic, watchdog reports","The government made $6.2 billion in overpayments across two unemployment insurance programs during the first year of the pandemic, according to a watchdog report released Tuesday.,Millions of Americans , as the coronavirus slammed the economy in spring 2020, forcing many to rely on jobless benefits and straining state unemployment systems. In March 2020, Congress passed legislation that boosted and supplemented regular unemployment benefits, including a new program called Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA), which extended help to workers left out of their state’s systems.,The report by the Government Accountability Office said the Labor Department reported that “states had identified more than $3.6 billion in PUA overpayments from March 2020 through February 2021.” In addition, states identified $2.6 billion in regular unemployment insurance overpayments in the last three quarters of 2020.,The report noted that “overpayments are not necessarily a result of fraud, though some may be.” States generally must require people to repay overpayments, but they can also waive that requirement if they find an individual was “without fault.” For instance, in October the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment , to 9,000 Coloradans after acknowledging that confusing forms for gig workers may have led some people to overestimate their incomes.,The numbers reported by the GAO represent a much higher overpayment amount than was previously known. When the GAO addressed the issue in ,, it found that Labor Department data showed $1.1 billion in PUA overpayments between March and December 2020, and it recommended that the agency collect the data from states.,The GAO’s January report also repeated and elaborated on concerns about fraud in an emergency relief program run by the Small Business Administration (SBA), called the Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) Program, which offers up to $10,000 to businesses and nonprofit organizations. By the end of December, the , 3.6 million low-interest loans worth $197 billion.,The GAO reported that the SBA’s independent auditor stated in December that the agency “was unable to provide adequate documentation to support a significant number of transactions and account balances related to EIDL due to inadequate processes and controls.”,The auditor also found over 6,000 EIDL loans worth more than $212 million “issued to potentially ineligible borrowers,” the GAO found.,Between May 2020 and February, the Justice Department announced charges against more than 50 defendants in more than 30 fraud cases connected with EIDL loans, the GAO said. As of February, at least five people had pleaded guilty to federal charges of defrauding the program.,The SBA told the watchdog that it was working to better document its processes and controls for future audits, and that it agreed with a GAO recommendation that it put in place an oversight plan for the disaster loans.",business
https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/03/31/takeaways-biden-infrastructure-plan/,5 key takeaways from Biden’s $2 trillion infrastructure plan,"President Biden is kicking off the campaign to get his second big initiative — a , — enacted by the summer.,Upgrading the nation’s infrastructure was on President Donald Trump’s wish list, but he wasn’t able to get it done. Biden is eager to show that he can deliver where the last president failed. Fixing the nation’s infrastructure has widespread support across the political spectrum because it creates jobs and tangibly improves nearly every community in the nation. The logjam in Congress has always been how to pay for the upgrades: raise taxes and tolls, cut other programs or take on more debt?,Biden is opting mainly for the tax hike option. He is proposing tax hikes on corporations. There’s already pushback from business leaders who claim this will hurt U.S. competitiveness. And there’s a vocal chorus questioning the White House math that says eight years of infrastructure spending would be paid for by 15 years of higher taxes on businesses.,As Biden makes his opening pitch for his infrastructure plan, here are the key takeaways.,The American Society of Civil Engineers gives the U.S. a , for infrastructure, noting that nearly 4 out of every 10 bridges are more than a half-century old and that a water main ruptures every two minutes. In most communities across the nation, people can quickly point to roads, bridges, pipes, ports and airports that look dated — and dangerous.,And then there’s the lack of reliable Internet in parts of the nation. The consequences of not having adequate high-speed Internet have been on display during the pandemic, as low-income students , because they didn’t have sufficient Internet access to attend online classes.,The White House is pitching this as a jobs plan and a way for the United States to keep up with other nations that are investing heavily in all different types of infrastructure, especially China.,About half of Biden’s plan goes toward traditional infrastructure. He calls for about $620 billion for roads, ports and bridges, including about $100 billion to bring high-speed Internet to all Americans. There’s another $111 billion to replace antiquated lead pipes and make drinking water safer, and $100 billion for retraining so workers can get higher-skilled jobs.,The other half of the bill makes investments to reduce climate change and modernize schools, manufacturing hubs and eldercare facilities. The White House argues these should also be viewed as critical infrastructure, but others see them as partisan Democratic priorities. This second $1 trillion in spending is where much of the debate is going to center. Biden will have to chose, as he did on the stimulus package, whether to take some of this other spending out to try to win GOP votes, or to stick to his plan and pass the bill with only Democratic votes.,For example, the proposal calls for $400 billion for housing for the elderly and disabled, more than $200 billion to upgrade public housing, low-income homes and $100 billion to retrofit schools. There’s also $300 billion to revive U.S. manufacturing, including a big investment in clean energy and climate change research and $50 billion for U.S. semiconductor manufacturing. Biden also wants to include the Protecting the Right to Organize Act that would make it ,.,To fund his more than $2 trillion plan, Biden is asking companies to pay up. Trump enacted the largest corporate tax rate cut in U.S. history, slashing the business tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent. Biden wants to increase it to 28 percent. The plan also calls for ensuring companies pay at least some taxes by imposing a 15 percent minimum tax on income and by taxing some foreign income of large global corporations to discourage them from moving operations overseas to tax havens.,Classic economic theory says that a tax increase will have some negative effects such as less investment or hiring. But many Democratic economists say the positives far outweigh the negatives and that companies can handle this new level of taxation. They point out this is a major investment that will make business easier in the United States.,But business groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce are already pushing back, saying this could make it harder for U.S. companies to compete with foreign ones that have lower tax rates. They say these major upgrades should be paid for by a wider group of the people who use them, such as by tolls on roads or raising the gas tax.,The White House is already getting criticized for portraying this as a plan that is “paid for” by tax increases, when the numbers don’t actually add up.,The proposal calls for about $2.3 trillion in spending over eight years, yet it would take 15 years for the proposed tax increases to generate that amount of money. That’s not how budgeting normally works.,“Put another way, roughly half of the spending will be paid for,” , Shai Akabas, director of economic policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center.,The standard way to look at spending like this is to add up how much it costs over a decade and how much of that cost is paid for over the same 10-year window. The proposed tax hikes generate only about $1.5 trillion over a decade, meaning this plan would add close to $1 trillion to the U.S. debt.,The United States still has nearly 10 million people out of work — more than the worst days of the Great Recession. While many economists predict a boom this summer as most Americans get vaccinated and start traveling and dining again, there are still likely to be ,. This infrastructure bill is widely expected to create a lot of good-paying jobs. The typical wage for a construction job is close to $30 an hour, according to the Labor Department, which is significantly higher than the median pay of,for all U.S. jobs.,Biden is haunted by the “jobless recovery” that occurred after the Great Recession, when it took nearly a decade to get everyone back to work. It’s why he wanted the large covid-19 relief package that passed earlier in March. This infrastructure package is another effort to ensure jobs do return quickly.,While much of the money from Biden’s $1.9 trillion covid-19 relief bill is likely to be spent in the next six months, this first-round $2 trillion infrastructure package would pump money into the economy for years to come, helping provide an extra boost to jobs and the economy throughout Biden’s first term.",business
https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/03/31/biden-drug-prices-trump/,Trump gave drug companies a last-minute win on prescription prices. Democrats want Biden to roll it back.,"Two weeks before President Donald Trump left office, his administration bestowed a parting gift on the U.S. prescription drug industry. It ,to block the government from citing exorbitant prices to seize control of a drug’s production.,The rule, drawn up by a division of the Commerce Department, would settle , over when government is justified in exercising “march in” rights over taxpayer-supported government inventions. The 40-year-old Bayh-Dole law gives the government power to grant a license to another manufacturer if a company is not making a government-sponsored invention available to the public on “reasonable terms.”,The government has never used the extraordinary power, regardless of which party has held the White House. But it has remained a battleground in Washington debates over the high prices of prescription drugs.,Under industry pressure and to the dismay of patient advocates, the Trump administration on Jan. 4 set in motion a plan to end the debate. Its proposed rule, which could become final in as little as a few months, would narrow the circumstances under which march-in rights could be deployed. The definition of “reasonable terms” would never apply to the price of a drug, no matter how high, under the Trump rule.,Democrats in Congress and health advocates say the proposed rule would eliminate one of the few impediments to sky-high drug prices in the United States. The nonprofit groups Knowledge Ecology International and Public Citizen, as well as several activist organizations with big email lists of grass-roots supporters, are demanding that President Biden’s administration reverse the Trump move.,The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, an industry trade group, has not yet submitted a comment on the proposed rule. The comment period closes April 5. In 2019, urging the Commerce Department to take this step, it said the move is needed to clarify the intent of the 1980 law.,Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo will have to decide whether to overturn the Trump action or make it final. Groups against the rule have used the official comment period to organize submissions of thousands of cookie-cutter messages from individual citizens denouncing the proposed restriction and calling on Raimondo to reverse the plan.,The Commerce Department declined to say how Raimondo views the issue.,Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra has forcefully supported march-in rights. Last year — as California attorney general, and as the coronavirus raged in his state — Becerra called on the government to seize production rights for ,, the first authorized treatment for covid-19, citing high prices and limited production.,That position put Becerra at odds with the leader of the National Institutes of Health, Francis Collins, who has said NIH lawyers have advised him that the price of a drug cannot be used as a justification for a march-in action.,In 2016, Becerra, then a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, also signed a letter by 50 congressional Democrats urging Collins to set up guidelines for when price could be used to justify marching in.,The Department of Health and Human Services, which will have an opportunity to provide input on the final rule, declined to comment.,Topher Spiro, associate director of health at the White House Office of Management and Budget, which reviews rules proposed by government agencies before they are finalized, has also argued previously for the use of march-in rights to incentivize lower drug prices, as lead author of a ,, where he was vice president for health policy. Asked whether Spiro would play a role in the review, the OMB did not respond.,Liberal Democrats in Congress are pushing the Biden administration to reject the Trump rule.,“It concerns me greatly that the Biden administration has not questioned this approach already,” said Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Tex.), the organizer of a letter this week signed by House and Senate Democrats denouncing the Commerce Department proposal and urging that it be scrapped. “We have so few tools to combat prescription price gouging. Why remove one of the only ones we have?”,In their letter, the three dozen lawmakers pointed out that the invention of drugs often relies heavily on government.,“As the angel investors underwriting the risk of development, taxpayers deserve access to these products on reasonable terms, including fair pricing that accounts for the investment made,” said the letter, signed by Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), among others.,The Bayh-Dole law dictates how technologies supported by NIH — through direct government scientific work or at research universities that receive billions in NIH research grants — are adopted and transformed into marketed products by private industry.,The Trump rule would apply to all government-backed inventions, but the,focus of the public debate generally has been over drugs.,By creating a licensing system that relied on the private sector to carry on the work started by taxpayer investment, Bayh-Dole is credited with helping fuel the boom in pharmaceutical research and investment over the past four decades.,But the law does not spell out what is meant by requiring drugs be made available to the public on “reasonable terms.”,The law’s co-authors, then-Sens. Birch Bayh (D-Ind.) and Bob Dole (R-Kan.), , in The Washington Post in 2002 that said controlling prices was never their intent. Critics of the law, however, have been quick to note that Dole and Bayh were no longer senators when they wrote that article. Dole, who left the Senate in 1996 during his campaign for president, became a Pfizer TV pitch man for Viagra in 1998; Bayh, who died in 2019, represented the Washington interests of numerous corporate clients after he left the Senate in 1981.,The current fight is being played out in a division of the Commerce Department called the National Institute of Standards and Technology. NIST’s mission is to encourage the transfer of government-sponsored inventions into the private sector.,Among backers of the Trump administration’s proposed rule is AUTM, formerly known as the Association of University Technology Managers. The association maintains that advocates of lower drug prices concocted “hidden meaning” in the Bayh-Dole march-in rights that needs to be definitively ruled out.,Permanently barring price from consideration is crucial to bolstering industry confidence that its licensing deals for taxpayer-supported inventions will not be undermined by government officials, the association maintains.,“We have brilliant researchers who are developing life-changing inventions across the country, and we need to get them into the hands of companies to develop them further. Anything that would perturb that delicate balance is concerning,” said Stephen Susalka, AUTM’s chief executive. “Pricing is outside the scope of Bayh-Dole. That’s the opposite of why Bayh-Dole was initially implemented.”",business
https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/03/30/voltswagen-volkswagen-electric-vehicles/,Volkswagen admits its name change was an April Fools’ Day prank,"Volkswagen is not renaming its U.S. subsidiary Voltswagen, declaring it instead an early April Fools’ Day prank.,Earlier Tuesday, Volkswagen issued a news release and tweet publicly announcing the name change. The company reversed course later that day, saying that the rebranding announcement was, in fact, a stunt to gin up interest in its electric vehicle strategy and the imminent arrival of its first long-range electric SUV.,“There will be no renaming of Volkswagen of America,” Volkswagen spokesman Mark Gillies said in an emailed statement Tuesday night. “The alleged renaming was designed to be an announcement in the spirit of April Fools’ Day, highlighting the launch of the all-electric ID.4 SUV and signaling our commitment to bringing electric mobility to all.”,But the announcement, which came two days before April 1, had already circulated far and wide before Volkswagen backtracked. Several media outlets, including The Washington Post, reported on the name change earlier Tuesday.,That left some branding experts scratching their heads about the strategy — particularly when the auto giant was at the center of a massive emissions scandal in September 2015. At that time, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency discovered Volkswagen had rigged millions of diesel cars with cheat devices that allowed them to test as low-emission, when in fact their output was 40 times the legal U.S. limit.,“It just shows a lack of understanding about what this company did and what its standing is in the world and how it needs to rectify its history and rebuild its image,” said Paul Argenti, a professor of corporate communications at Dartmouth’s Tuck School of Business. “Goofing around about who it is and what it’s trying to do, particularly with anything related to sustainability strikes me as really, really bad taste. It’s just terrible.”,On Monday, a version of the rebrand announcement was “accidentally” posted on VW’s website, then disappeared, prompting social media speculation on whether the name change was simply an April Fools’ Day stunt. But VW confirmed the switch-over in a ,, which has now been removed from its website.,A , of the release shows that Volkswagen had said it would adopt the new name in May.,“We might be changing out our K for a T, but what we aren’t changing is this brand’s commitment to making best-in-class vehicles for drivers and people everywhere,” Scott Keogh, president and chief executive of the company’s U.S. arm said in the release.,Apart from its emissions scandal, Volkswagen also faced an uproar last year when it was , for a racist advertisement posted on its Instagram account. The 10-second clip depicted a pair of oversize White hands dragging a Black man away from a new VW car, and flicking him violently into a restaurant called “Petit Colon,” a name with overtones of colonization. Volkswagen, which was founded by the Nazi government in the 1930s, removed the ad and said it was “an insult to every decent person.”,Companies attempt public April Fools’ stunts nearly every year, attempting to rouse attention for themselves in what they hope to be a fun tone. Google Maps has a history of introducing a feature or game as a prank, participating along with other tech companies such as Reddit and Roku.,Microsoft marketing chief Chris Capossela sent out a note to employees ,announcing that the company had decided against doing any public-facing stunts because “data tells us these stunts have limited positive impact and can actually result in unwanted news cycles.”,Argenti cautions brands against these types of April Fools’ Day stunts in general, though he acknowledges there might be a way for companies to subtly poke fun at themselves.,“But the last thing you would want to do is to call attention to your sustainability in relation to your cause given that you were fined billions of dollars,” he said of Volkswagen.,In June 2016, , to settle shareholder claims tied to the,emissions scandal, in one of the biggest class-action settlements in U.S. history. In January 2017, Volkswagen paid $4.3 billion in criminal and civil fines after pleading guilty in a case brought by the U.S. Justice Department. The scandal has cost the German auto giant more than 31 billion euros (more than $34.6 billion) in fines and settlements, executives have said.,Several automakers are doubling down on EVs. In January, General Motors pledged to stop making gasoline-powered passenger cars, vans and SUVs by 2035. Jaguar announced in February that it would go all electric by 2025, and earlier this month Volvo said it would phase out vehicles with internal-combustion engines by 2030.,“A golden age of EV is on the horizon,” Dan Ives, managing director of equity research at Wedbush Securities, wrote in a February research note.,Headquartered in Herndon, Va., Volkswagen of America is a subsidiary of Volkswagen AG, Europe’s biggest automaker.,Even though some found the move controversial, Richard Levick, president and chief executive of crisis communications firm Levick, argued Volkswagen’s move was “brilliant” as a move to remedy its electric vehicles getting overlooked.,“Now everybody is talking about their progress in electric vehicles,” he said. “Now they’ve forever connected electronic vehicles and Volkswagen.”",business

The ,provides for payments of up to $1,400 for eligible individuals and $2,800 for couples filing joint returns. Dependents, regardless of age, also receive $1,400 each.,The IRS had said it would automatically send economic impact payments, which is what the agency calls the stimulus payments, to people who did not file returns but who receive Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Social Security retirement, survivor or disability (SSDI), Railroad Retirement, or Veterans Affairs (VA) benefits. But many of these federal beneficiaries, including nearly 30 million Social Security and SSI benefit recipients, have been waiting for news about their payments.,“I am a 69-year-old widow living on SSI widow’s benefits,” a Florida woman said by email. “I can use the extra money, and I hear on the news every day how many people in my area have received their third stimulus payment. What is going on? I can really use this money.”,The wait is coming to an end if all goes as planned, the IRS and Treasury said. Now that the IRS has the information it needs from the Social Security Administration, the majority of stimulus payments to federal beneficiaries will be disbursed electronically — through direct deposits or to existing Direct Express cards, which are prepaid debit cards used to deliver federal benefits.,However, stimulus payments for VA beneficiaries, who do not regularly file tax returns, could be delayed,until mid-April. The agency said it is reviewing data for VA benefit recipients and expects to determine a payment date and provide more details soon.,“We know how important these payments are, and we are doing everything we can to make these payments as fast as possible to these important individuals,” IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig said in the statement.,Here’s a roundup of other announcements the IRS has made over the past several days.,— ,. The payments are automatic, so there’s nothing beneficiaries have to do. However, some federal benefit recipients still may need to file 2020 tax returns to claim the economic impact payments for qualified dependents. The IRS otherwise will not know to disburse the payments for the dependents.,Also, be aware that the form of payment may be different from in earlier stimulus rounds. So, be sure to check your mail for either a check or prepaid debit card.,[,],Eventually, with updates from IRS, you should be able to check the status of your stimulus payment by using the “,” tool at ,, which is available in English and Spanish.,— , Personal protective equipment — such as masks, hand sanitizer and sanitizing wipes used to prevent the spread of the , — is now deductible as a medical expense, the IRS , last week.,The IRS said taxpayers can use funds in their health savings accounts (HSAs) or flexible spending account (FSAs) to buy paper and cloth masks. Hand sanitizer and surface cleaners that are used to prevent the spread of the virus also are eligible. With an FSA and HSA, you can set aside money, pretax, to pay certain qualified health expenses.,The contribution limit for an employee who chooses to participate in an FSA is $2,750 for 2021.,Contributions are not subject to federal income tax, Social Security tax or Medicare tax.,Health savings accounts are linked to high-deductible health plans (HDHPs), and, like FSAs, they also can be used for various out-of-pocket expenses. The maximum amount you’re allowed to contribute to an HSA for 2021 is $3,600 as an individual or $7,200 as a family. People 55 or older can contribute an extra $1,000 annually to an HSA.,— , In other ,, the IRS said it is giving individuals additional time to make 2020 contributions to their individual retirement accounts, such as an IRA or Roth IRA.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/03/30/corporations-racial-justice-cancel-culture/,Corporations are working with social media influencers to cancel-proof their racial justice initiatives,"Days after , died under the knee of a White police officer, Procter & Gamble began work on an ad campaign aimed at White people simply titled “,.”,Over close-up shots of a pale, freckled back, then a single blue eye, these words appeared: “Being White in America is not needing to state your life matters. And when your life matters, you have power. Now is the time to use it.”,The call to action on prime-time television from one of the world’s largest advertisers was risky.,Advocating for racial allyship is not something corporate America has traditionally embraced. But the , against police brutality last year prompted many companies to , in combating systemic racism and pushing,White Americans to reflect on their understanding of race and privilege — all while trying to increase market share. With every new well-meaning — or opportunistic, depending on the details — effort comes the potential for public and painful missteps.,“We sell Tide,” said Damon Jones, a Procter & Gamble spokesman who leads the company’s racial justice initiatives. “We don’t ever want anyone to be upset at Tide.”,So Procter & Gamble sought outside help to navigate this era of racial justice protests. It joined a growing number of companies consulting diverse panels of “real people” with cultural expertise — community leaders, activists and academics — on everything from ad campaigns to whether to celebrate Black History Month, according to Joshua DuBois, chief executive of Gauge, a technology company connecting corporations with a vast network of social media influencers.,“Traditional market research is not built for this cultural moment,” DuBois said. He and co-founders Brandon Andrews and Alfred Dunn recently launched a “cultural navigator” platform called NXTLAB of more than 10,000 opinion-makers whom companies can tap confidentially for candid feedback to spare themselves possible embarrassment.,Their expertise covers multigenerational, multiracial perspectives on racial equality as well as LGBTQ, gender and women’s rights.,Among the platform’s thought leaders: April Reign, who launched the #OscarsSoWhite campaign for more diverse representation in Hollywood; Jamilah Lemieux, a millennial writer focused on race and gender; and David Johns, executive director of the National Black Justice Coalition, a civil rights organization focused on Black LGBTQ people.,The influencers are paid between $500 and more than $1,500 for one-on-one consultations,and $10 to $100 for survey responses, DuBois said. Gauge charges companies a subscription fee (starting at $5,000 a month for nonprofit groups) that includes daily emails encapsulating key news developments, access to a website featuring experts weighing in on those moments, and a set number of custom research projects.,The goal, DuBois said, is an “equitable economy for cultural understanding” where leaders of color are paid for helping brands avoid major mistakes in their ad campaigns, corporate policies, diversity and inclusion plans, philanthropy and product launches.,Some firms have been warned against making pronouncements that could be dismissed by consumers as exploitative, DuBois said.,“A couple of companies wanted to launch big Black History Month marketing campaigns and our community said, ‘Do not do that because you haven’t fulfilled , after Breonna Taylor and George Floyd,’” DuBois said. “You need to put your money where your mouth is in terms of actual work first.”,No company wants to be canceled, even temporarily. Take Pepsi, whose , featuring Kendall Jenner strutting through a protest to deliver a can of soda to a police officer drew consumer backlash and was pulled. Or Starbucks, whose short-lived 2015 campaign for baristas to scrawl “,” on millions of coffee cups in hopes of sparking conversations about racial tensions was criticized as insincere corporatism.,Each marketing misfire provokes a cycle of consumer outrage and calls to boycott, followed by corporate apologies and promises to do better. Instead of being dragged on social media by influencers with large numbers of followers, DuBois said companies can engage them well ahead of any campaign launch.,“These are the people who make good or bad ideas trend, shaping the culture every day,” DuBois said. “It would be a market failure to not tap into this wisdom.”,International makeup chain Sephora convened the NXTLAB network to guide a study on racial bias in retail, and, in January to reduce discriminatory practices in its stores and diversify its product lines. Tech company Snap tapped the network to think more deeply about how to develop inclusive augmented reality tools.,They’ve helped corporations featuring Black models and actors in ad campaigns to also consider diversity in size and skin tone. They’ve advised companies on how to show up — even virtually — at events such as last summer’s , honoring the , of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s “,” address at the Lincoln Memorial. And they’ve recommended against using the word “,” in television show titles.,“When you can ease someone into a conversation about representation and discrimination, it’s easier than banging someone over the head with it,” said Reign,,a trained lawyer turned equity advocate. “Easing someone in can lead to faster results because there is less pushback.”,In 2017, Procter & Gamble received more than 10,000 letters and phone calls, the most “hate mail” the company says it’s ever received, accusing the company of “race baiting” after it released a , directly addressing the racism their children face in American life.,“‘,’ was the first controversial campaign that we did, designed to get people talking about racial bias — bias that exists within the walls of P&G, within the advertising industry, within a lot of different places,” Jones said. “Frankly, when we saw the reaction, we knew we needed to continue that discussion.”,So executives forged ahead with another racially provocative campaign titled “,” in 2019.,This time, though, it sought feedback from influencers that Gauge had tapped early on in a beta version of the platform before launching this spring. The racially diverse group helped P&G adjust the intensity of the actors’ facial expressions and emotions. The result: a more subtle film depicting the daily microaggressions experienced by Black men — no matter how accomplished. No words. Just telling glances.,“The challenge was to show the action and the emotion in a true and pure way such that Black men said yes, that’s my experience,” Jones said, “and in a way that White people didn’t get turned off because we were waving the finger and accusing them of being racist.”,“These conversations are so nuanced and our goal is to bring people together,” Jones said. “It is much more layered than just telling the truth.”,The spot listed a company website with , about racial bias, including a ,, which Jones said P&G created with the help of the Gauge influencers. With the company better prepared for the public reaction than when it released “The Talk,” Jones said P&G was able to launch dozens of community conversations in schools across the nation. “We want to be more effective in drawing people into the discussion rather than just driving people back into their corners,” he said.,Jones said that P&G recognizes that its messaging projected into consumer homes shapes how communities see themselves and each other. That’s why it felt compelled to issue a directive to White people to step up in the fight against racial injustice after Floyd’s killing, when it released “,” online and across major network and cable TV channels.,The emphasis this time was less on blame, he said, but on the fact that everyone has a role to play in fixing societal structures that are biased against Black people. And public reception was much more balanced as more corporations began speaking out about social justice issues, he said.,“The intent was to get the silent majority actively involved,” Jones said. “We didn’t want to just create another ad or film. We needed people to act differently.”,Promoting community discussions and encouraging White Americans to fight for racial justice seems far afield for a company that sells toilet paper, toothpaste and tampons. But for many companies, pressure came from consumers as well as their own employees — and ultimately, they say, standing up for racial justice can help increase their bottom line.,Sonya Grier, an American University professor whose research focuses on race in the marketplace, said corporations have not traditionally advocated for marginalized groups and instead focused on targeting groups most profitable to them.,“They are now trying to support a community so they have sustainability within the marketing systems that they have,” Grier said. “It’s like smoothing the ground in ways to still accomplish the goals they want to accomplish — which is to sell products and make money.”,Black and Hispanic consumers are more likely now to expect brands to take a stance on social justice issues, according to a ,. The market research firm has also reported that Black shoppers typically , on cosmetics, hair products and skin care than White consumers, amounting to , each year. And Black consumers are more likely than other demographic groups to speak up through social media.,Sephora, which Black shoppers have ,, first worked with Gauge experts in 2019 to better understand how Black women leaders view the beauty company and experience racial profiling in retail. They wanted Sephora to sell more representative products, including those reflecting the full array of Black skin tones, and forge relationships with more Black influencers.,Chief Marketing Officer Deborah Yeh said Sephora has since commissioned a panel of equity advisers for quarterly conversations to complement its traditional market research.,When Sephora pledged to devote at least 15 percent of its shelf space to Black-owned beauty brands last summer,,Yeh said the equity advisers urged the company to also create a path for Black entrepreneurs by expanding recruiting and ensuring they knew the “secret sauce” to making it onto Sephora shelves.,“The biggest trade show in beauty is in Milan. Are they going to be in Milan? Probably not,” Yeh said. “We are digging much deeper into scouting, beyond just letting them come to us.”,Sephora has re-engineered its,six-year-old,brand development,program — initially created to help women access funding, create prototypes and position their products — to focus exclusively on entrepreneurs of color,,with the intent to distribute at Sephora at the end of the six-month boot camp. And it’s tapping some of the equity advisers to act as mentors and to connect with a more diverse group of business owners.,The company has also increased signage in its stores of up-and-coming brands, with mini-profiles of the founders, Yeh said, because “consumers want to know.”,“The speed at which cultural conversations are taking place is breathtaking and the breadth of those conversations are really expanding,” Yeh said. “It’s helpful for us to have a pulse on something that’s broader than what we had in the past.”,Lauryl Schraedly, global head of consumer insights on Snap’s marketing team, said the Gauge network is “unlike anything else in the industry,” something especially valuable at this time because “a lot of people in the market research industry look like me, a White woman.”,Snap began working with the influencers last summer and has sought help understanding which events and issues that brands should be a part of, getting feedback on how people are using its augmented reality filters and staying informed on what various communities care about.,In 2016, the company was pilloried for a Snapchat , that allowed users to put Marley’s face and dreadlocks on themselves and another that turned users into a , with slanted eyes, buck teeth and a conical hat. Critics said the filters amounted to digital blackface and yellowface.,Last June, it released a , commemorating ,, a holiday marking emancipation, that prompted users to smile to break digital chains symbolizing slavery. The company apologized, removed the filter and attributed its error to internal miscommunication.,Two months later, during the March on Washington, Snap unveiled filters and other creative tools designed by Black artists that support ,, including , advocating for racial justice that could be also purchased in real life.,After commissioning a study in December,on how companies have celebrated ,, Snap in February,released a,, a Black cowboy on his journey to becoming the best bull rider in the world. It also rolled out bitmoji celebrating “Black excellence,” including one promoting Black history “24/7/365.”,“We can’t just show up in February and then go silent for the rest of the year,” Schraedly said.,Producing effective campaigns promoting racial justice also helps companies better sell their products, said Jones, of Procter & Gamble. The company is working with Gauge to address systemic bias in the marketing and advertising industry and , to tell more inclusive stories about Black America.,“There is an economic benefit as well as a societal benefit,” Jones said. “When you get this stuff right, it’s good for business.”",business

In January, 44 percent of U.S. workers working remotely surveyed by , said they prefer to work from home once restrictions are lifted, while 39 percent said they want to return to the office.,Lockheed Martin, which estimates,that between 40 and 45 percent of its workforce would be “multidimensional” — its term for hybrid — has put its managers through roughly 20 hours of training, some of which focused on having a “growth mind-set,” a term coined by researcher Carol Dweck that refers to someone’s skills and abilities having the potential to change and grow.,“This is a new world, and you have to accept it as such,” said Greg Karol, Lockheed Martin’s chief human resources officer. “We were a company with only 3 percent full-time telecommuters a year ago. You move to this new phase, I don’t expect them to be experts.”,Sara Wechter, Citigroup’s global head of human resources, said the company plans to start inviting employees in North America back to the office in July and hopes about 50 percent can return to the office part time in September. It designated each job in the company as “resident,” “remote” or “hybrid,” with the vast majority falling into the last category.,“I cannot picture Citi ever saying we’re going fully remote,” Wechter said. Yet whereas in the past the default was that an employee would work on-site, in the future the default will be hybrid, she said. Fraser’s memo was an effort to be clear that “we’re better together,” Wechter said. “At the end of the day we’ve proven we can work in a hybrid situation. We can work from home. There’s got to be the balance.”,The law firm Allen & Overy said recently that it plans to eventually bring its lawyers back in the office about 60 percent of the time but that it won’t measure hybrid schedules on a weekly basis. “Our expectation is you will organize your working life so that 60 percent of that working time over a year is spent in the office,” said Tim House, the firm’s U.S. senior partner.,Decisions will be left up to individual partners on how to bring people in, and teams might work several weeks at a time,in the office while finishing a project and then spend a couple weeks out of it. But he expects the change to be permanent. “It will be a paradigm shift and one that will endure,” he said, with the firm going from one that was “permissive” of flexible work in certain arrangements “to one that is now communicating that the appropriate balance is 60 percent in the office.”,At TIAA, roughly 85 percent of its workforce is expected to work between two and four days in the office. That’s a much better model, said TIAA Chief People Officer Sean Woodroffe, than one the firm had in the past, when a large percentage of people were fully remote. By 2018, roughly 30 to 40 percent of TIAA’s employees were working from home full time, a level considered high for the financial services industry at the time and one it realized wasn’t working, hurting collaboration. Before the pandemic, it was down to just 15 percent remote in 2019, with the firm calling off-site workers back in.,When too many workers are remote, “you run into issues that people that are in the office have face time, they have opportunities, they’re interacting with employees a little bit differently than the employees that are working remotely,” Woodroffe said. When most employees have some time on-site and some working from home, it should help with,those concerns, he said. “What we’re moving to is something that’s completely different.”",business
https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/03/30/fed-inflation-bad-economy-low-wage/,The soft underbelly to a looming economic boom: Millions will miss out,"A major reason the Federal Reserve insists Americans shouldn’t fret about the risk of runaway inflation boils down to a letter Alexia Figueroa received from the hotel she worked at for 15 years.,Figueroa was furloughed from her job as a restaurant hostess and server at the Kimpton Nine Zero Hotel in Boston last March, and she’s waited for the call to come back ever since. The job helped her family buy a house and provided health insurance for her two children.,Then last week, Figueroa learned that she and , had been fired.,“The recovery looks like it is coming soon, but when they sent me the letter saying I don’t have the job, it’s like they are keeping me away from the recovery,” Figueroa, 39, said. “To find another hospitality job is hard for me in this moment.”,By many accounts, the economy is projected to grow at its , in four decades this year, bolstered by President Biden’s , and more widespread ,. The rosier picture has economists , whether such a forceful turnaround will overheat the economy and trigger cycles of inflation ,The Fed ,. Its explanation typically includes academic debates about ,or what the mathematical link is between unemployment and prices.,But the answer this time is also much simpler: Despite the headline numbers, the economy is still in bad shape for millions of Americans. And for many workers like Figueroa, jobs may not come back even if the economy booms again.,The bleak reality is coming into sharper focus as the Biden administration , an at least $3 trillion infrastructure and jobs package on Wednesday, one that’s designed to confront global climate change and rebuild America’s roads, bridges and other infrastructure. The package could provide additional support to the economy in the years to come, but there are more imminent challenges, especially as , cases , across the United States.,All the while, the scars of pandemic are far from healed.,The leisure and , sector — which largely employs people of color and women — is down almost 3.5 million jobs, or roughly 20 percent of its pre-pandemic level. Workers who had been in the bottom 25 percent of earners faced an unemployment rate of around 22 percent in February, compared with the , of 6.2 percent, according to a , last week by Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard,Economists say many of the 9.5 million jobs still missing from the labor market will gradually return. But it’s unclear how long it will take, and which jobs will vanish forever in the meantime. Businesses are increasingly looking to technology and automation to cut the cost of labor, compounding the risks of long-term unemployment for some of the country’s most vulnerable workers.,The bleak picture shows the darker side of the Fed’s plan to keep interest rates near zero for quite awhile. Historically, the Fed raised rates and slowed the economy to keep inflation from creeping too high, even at the cost of higher unemployment.,Now the Fed goes by a ,, one that tolerates higher inflation if that means more people can get a job.,But if all of that growth leaves behind people like Figueroa, the Fed’s path to getting as many people back to work as possible will be even harder to forge.,“Although the outlook has brightened considerably, the fog of uncertainty associated with the virus has yet to lift completely, and current employment and inflation outcomes remain far from our goals,” Brainard said last week.,Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell has , that getting the pandemic , is the best way to heal the economy. Vaccinations help people return to jobs that depend on person-to-person contact, Powell says. As people spend money on long-awaited vacations and entertainment, hotels and concert venues will be able to bring workers back on the payroll, for example.,But some jobs may never return. In her speech, Brainard cited a , that found roughly half of chief financial officers from large firms and about one-third of those from small firms, said they were “using, or planning to use, automation or technology to reduce reliance on labor.”,Many companies already had plans to automate jobs before the pandemic. But Robert Kaplan, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, told The Washington Post that the pandemic accelerated that shift. Kaplan said it’s hard to think of a business in his district — which spans Texas and parts of Louisiana and New Mexico — that doesn’t mention automation and ways to trim costs in their conversations.,Restaurants are using technology for online preorders and pickups, Kaplan said. Package delivery and logistics centers are on a similar path. Call centers that were already exploring ways to automate will likely ramp up those efforts, Kaplan said.,In other cases, businesses say they can’t predict how quickly customer demand will rebound as the pandemic winds down, making them hesitant to rehire.,“What I’m hearing from small businesses, medium-sized businesses and large business is that wherever possible right now, they’re looking for ways to use technology more than in the past to run leaner, and to be more efficient,” Kaplan said.,Such permanent shifts in the labor market could pose a crucial test for the Fed. The central bank is supposed to guard against inflation — the annual change in the price of goods and services — and get the economy to full employment. Its main policy lever rests in interest rates, which the Fed can raise or lower depending on what’s happening in the economy.,Inflation , the Fed’s 2 percent target for years, even as unemployment fell in the years after the Great Recession. That dynamic , the long-held view that as the labor market tightened and employers raised wages to compete for scarce workers, prices would rise as businesses passed high labor costs onto consumers.,Inflation is expected to , this year, but Powell says any price increases will be temporary and won’t pulse through the entire economy. Still, economists and , are trying to pin down how much inflation the Fed will tolerate before it raises rates.,Just as important will be how the Fed judges progress in the labor market, particularly for low-wage workers and people of color who didn’t benefit until the tail end of the expansion that followed the Great Recession.,Raphael Bostic, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, described the uneven recovery as “the signature characteristic” of the pandemic’s economic fallout. In a , last week, Bostic highlighted disparities across wage levels, gender, race and industry and said eliminating persistent gaps “is essential if we are to generate stronger economic growth.”,When it comes to monetary policy, Bostic said looking to the overall unemployment rate won’t be enough.,“I’m going to be committed to pushing back against the notion that we’re all fine if the aggregate number is at a certain point, but some of these targeted populations are still in significant distress, or in a more of a crisis type of period,” Bostic told reporters last week.,the official unemployment rate ,. They say a more precise gauge is the employment-to-population ratio, which measures the number of people currently employed against the total working-age population.,The ratio for Black prime-age workers is 7.2 percentage points lower than for White workers, which is 77.8 percent. The ratio is 6.2 percentage points lower for Hispanic workers than for White workers — an increase in each gap of about three percentage points from pre-pandemic lows in October 2019, according to Brainard’s speech.,Measuring how many people are still out of work is one challenge. Making sense of this unusual and complex crisis is yet another.,Abigail Wozniak, a labor economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, says there are still “a lot of asterisks” when assessing the health of the U.S. economy. Three rounds of ,, enhanced unemployment benefits and a host of other relief measures have all helped families stay afloat over the past year.,The unprecedented levels of fiscal support make it hard to draw clear-cut conclusions about the labor market, for example. At the same time, Wozniak notes that , have been able to,blurring the picture even more.,“The unemployment rate is dramatically worse than we’ve seen in the past, but the level of support is dramatically better,” Wozniak said. “And so when we try to create this picture of overall well-being, we’re just in a very new territory.”,Eventually, the flood of support from Congress will wear off. Businesses that experiment with leaner staffs or automation may decide to stick with it.,And economists fear that the longer people are out of the workforce, the harder it is to get back in.,“While there’s some exuberance, rightfully so, that the economy is going to rebound and rebound fast, and we’re going to see a lot of growth, the way that will be experienced by workers is going to be just as uneven and unequal as the recession was,” said Molly Kinder, who focuses on low-wage workers and women at the Brookings Institution.,That is Figueroa’s worry too.,Figueroa, who is from El Salvador, said she’s depended on stimulus payments and extended unemployment benefits to help support her family. Her husband also works in hospitality as a server, but he is only employed two days per week.,She fears what losing her job means for her family’s financial stability and worries about paying her mortgage. The Unite Here Local 26 Union, which represents much of Kimpton Nine Zero’s staff, said the company violated its contract and did not have grounds to fire its employees. In a statement, the hotel said its actions “comply with the union contract that has been in place for years.”,Other Boston hotels have committed to recalling their own workers if business returns, making it more difficult for her to find a position. Figueroa says she has the training, but she needs the job.,“We are here, ready to work,” Figueroa said. “We already know our job, so we don’t have to train as much. We know what we do, and we love what we do.”",business

Protracted economic sanctions on Xinjiang — the heart of China’s cotton production — could permanently reroute some supply chains out of China. The Xinjiang crackdown, which the U.S. State Department has declared “genocide,” also threatens to become a defining part of President Xi Jinping’s historical legacy.,Deborah Mayersen, an Australian expert in genocide prevention, said Beijing’s threats to Western companies were directed at a domestic audience as much as the foreign one, with senior officials seeking to project legitimacy at home in the face of sanctions.,“China is trying to win a propaganda war at home,” she said.,China’s Xinjiang policies , to impose on March 22 its first sanctions on China since the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown.

The Mercator Institute for China Studies, which is the largest European think tank focused on China, and Newcastle University anthropologist Joanne Smith Finley were targeted by Beijing last week.,By Sunday, more than 400 scholars had signed a letter of support for Finley.,“The Chinese Communist Party has long used covert attempts to silence critics outside its territory, but these overt new measures against academics are a serious escalation,” said the letter they signed, ,.,Chinese state media have also , that unspecified Xinjiang companies were planning to sue Adrian Zenz, a prominent U.S.-based Xinjiang researcher.,Human rights activists issued calls over the weekend for fashion brands to resist caving in to China’s threats of boycott. Human Rights Watch , Inditex, the parent company of Zara; PVH, parent company of Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein; and VF, parent company of the North Face and JanSport, have all since removed statements on Xinjiang.,

https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/03/27/theaters-recovery-regal-mooky/,Why the head of Regal Cinemas believes movie theaters are on the verge of a major comeback,"Cineworld is one of the most important entertainment companies in the world, and Mooky Greidinger is the most important person at Cineworld.,The movie-theater chain operates 2,500 screens throughout Europe and Regal Cinema’s 7,500 screens in the United States, making it the world’s second-largest chain and  a key determinant of what gets seen by millions.,After a difficult year in which Cineworld reported its first-ever loss thanks to the pandemic, the company is now experiencing a setback on its reopening plans. The slow vaccine rollout in Europe has put the brakes on a quick comeback there. Questions linger over whether American consumers will flock to theaters. Warner Bros., which has some of theaters’ most anticipated movies, will continue to release its films ,on HBO Max through the end of the year, flouting the so-called theatrical window.,And Disney this week , it would roll out its Marvel title “Black Widow” and “101 Dalmatians”-set picture “Cruella” on Disney Plus at the same time as theaters, further delaying exclusive new product.,But Greidinger, Cineworld’s chief executive, believes bright days lie just ahead. He has made a decision to begin opening Regal theaters in the U.S. ,. The Israel-based executive (he started his career at his family’s chain Cinema City before it became part of Cineworld) has also just cut a deal with Warner Bros. for a 45-day window in the U.S. And he is maintaining his optimism despite the Disney news, which he says deeply disappointed him.,The Washington Post talked to him by phone from Tel Aviv. (The conversation has been compressed and edited lightly for clarity.),Of course I’m upset. Movies like “Cruella” and “Black Widow” deserve a significant window to get maximum revenue. Disney’s gross in 2019 alone is more than $13 billion [worldwide]. I believe it’s a mistake. But it’s not my decision to make.,I am sure at the end of day there will be a solution. Maybe not for these movies, maybe for the future. But they just made the announcement two days ago. We’ll wait and see how it develops and then make our decisions.,This is the nature of partnership; sometimes you have to give things up. It was clear Warner Bros. could not back off the commitment it made. For us, we were willing to compromise on a few movies for the sake of the future.,I don’t think I can hide fact that I didn’t like it. But I’m not a guy with bad blood. I explained my view to Warner Bros. before they took the decision and afterward. There was some tension; there was some business negotiation. At the end of the day, I think we got a good deal.,Our relationships with the studios go back over 90 years. It’s a partnership. Studios need cinemas and cinemas need studios. We accept windows cannot be as long as they were in [the] past. I don’t think any studio opposes the view that theatrical exclusivity is a must, that it’s the best way to maximize income from movies. I think this [WB] deal is setting a tone, which is so important for the industry. I hope in the coming weeks we’re able to move forward with Paramount, Sony, Disney and, of course, with Universal.,Of course, for much of 2020 we were bleeding money. But we have also been raising a lot of money. We just raised $200 million more [through a ,. We have enough liquidity for the reopening and will be cash-flow positive very soon after.,We have good liquidity even until the end of the year. I’m not worried, but I’m cautious. I’m preparing ourselves for a bad situation. But I’m sure this time it will be good.,We’ve closed 20 theaters [out of about 750] across all our territories. About 17 of them are in the U.S. All of them were underperforming, and we could reach agreements with landlords where we could leave early. We didn’t lose any of our flagships. And we’re going to open five new theaters. Each of these new cinemas will probably do the business of three old cinemas.,It was really disappointing. I was ready to bet that everything would be back in June, latest July. If someone would have told me that it would be a year and still theaters are closed, I would think he’s crazy.,The first quarter has been very frustrating. On the other hand, we’re now counting vaccinations instead of test results. I’m sure Europe will move forward quickly once they solve this issue. In July the theatrical business will be back there. Not at 2019 levels. But completely different from where it stands now. We’re also now standing in a situation with “Godzilla vs. Kong” as the first release [next week] in the United States. In May I think we can be in full force in the U.S.,I think you just need to look at Asia. In China and Japan [where covid cases have subsided and theaters have reopened] they’re breaking records — not covid records but all-time records. It’s amazing to think a new Chinese-language movie like , is the biggest opening ever in the history of the industry in one territory — bigger even than “Avengers.” It showed the promise of entertainment. I cannot count how many people have asked me when the new “Top Gun” will come out, when “Matrix” will come out.,The human being’s nature is not to stay home seven days a week. It’s to go out at least once or twice a week, whether it’s to a park or a restaurant or a cinema. There’s nothing to compare laughing together, crying together, being frightened together. A boy dating a girl for the first time does not want to sit in the living room with his parents.,It always happens in our industry. It’s 120 years old, and there are so many times someone says, “This will be the end of cinema,” and then it survives. Cinema will live forever.",business
https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/03/26/usps-dejoy-act/,Democrats introduce ‘DeJoy Act’ in opening salvo against USPS leader’s mail-slowing plan,"Democrats are swarming to block a key piece of Postmaster General Louis DeJoy’s 10-year restructuring plan for the U.S. Postal Service, casting doubt on the feasibility of his proposals for achieving financial stability for the agency.,A group of House Democrats on Friday introduced legislation to prohibit the Postal Service from lengthening mail-delivery windows and require it to adhere to present service expectations. They named the bill the Delivering Envelopes Judiciously On-time Year-round Act, or DEJOY Act.,One House aide involved in postal reform legislation introduced in February said some members of the caucus are leery of proceeding with efforts to address the Postal Service’s financial obligations given that DeJoy’s 10-year plan includes sharp reductions in service, including slower timetables for mail delivery and reduced post office hours.,Separately, Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro (D), to block the service cuts. His office said in a statement Friday that it was encouraged that DeJoy recognizes the legal obligations to secure limited regulatory approvals, but said it remained concerned about timely mail delivery.,Mounting concern among Democrats, who can afford few defections from their narrow House majority if they hope to pass postal reform, could throw off the postmaster general’s entire “Delivering for America” proposal.,DeJoy hopes to save the Postal Service $160 billion over the next decade through a combination of austerity measures, postage price increases and projected package volume growth. But the largest single piece of his plan is dependent on Congress repealing its pre-funding mandate for retiree health care costs, which runs about $5 billion a year. Instead, the agency wants to wind down those payments and enroll future retirees in Medicare, a proposal worth $44 billion.,A bill introduced by Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney, chair of the powerful House Oversight and Reform Committee, includes both components.,But DeJoy’s designs to slow the mail — even as the Postal Service attempts to rebound from generationally poor service metrics in recent months — and perceived animus toward lawmakers in recent hearings have made those prospects more difficult.,Under current “service standards,” or the amount of time the Postal Service allots itself to deliver a piece of mail, it should take no more than three days for a first-class mail item to arrive, regardless of where it is being sent in the United States. Under DeJoy’s new plan, the three-day standard would still apply to 70 percent of first-class mail items. But for the remaining 30 percent — which is roughly 5 billion pieces of mail — the benchmark will go from three to as many as five days based on destination mileage.,“This particular change, going from 100 percent of first-class mail being delivered one to three days to only 70 percent, would be a nonstarter, in my opinion, with the American people,” Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.), who introduced the DEJOY Act with six Democratic co-sponsors, told The Washington Post.,DeJoy’s plan presents service cuts as a necessity given falling mail volume, inconsistency in the Postal Service’s largely private-sector “middle mile” transportation network and spiraling transportation costs required to ferry fewer pieces of mail cross-country.,Postal Service spokesman David Partenheimer said in an emailed statement that the agency would “strongly oppose a freeze on the current unachieved and unachievable service standards,” and said that though the agency had tried to meet delivery expectations in recent years, it largely has fallen short.,“The modifications we are proposing will enable us to improve reliability by shifting volume from unreliable air transportation to more reliable ground transportation,” Partenheimer said, “and facilitate network improvements that will ensure that we can meet or exceed 95 percent on-time delivery across all of our mail and shipping product classes during all times of the year.”,In an interview Tuesday, DeJoy told The Post that the Postal Service did not view the cuts as a fundamental disruption in service, and that the agency has already submitted plans to the Postal Regulatory Commission to change service standards.,“We do not believe that any of these changes that we are proposing or moving forward on are hugely impacting or changing the structure and the service of the Postal Service,” DeJoy said.,The Postal Service’s chief financial officer, Joseph Corbett, cautioned during a Tuesday webinar announcing the plan that failure to swiftly adopt any of its tenets would come with significant ramifications.,“If we encounter roadblocks with any of the major elements, we quickly get into negative territory and may face annual losses for the coming decade,” Corbett said. “The scale of consequences from being constrained or slowed in our implementation of initiatives would be sizable.”,But mail industry experts worry that degrading service standards could chase away businesses that can no longer afford or tolerate slower, more expensive delivery. DeJoy’s plan also calls for price increases, but he declined to disclose them in the webinar or in the interview. Several mailing firms and advocacy organizations are suing the agency’s regulator to block it from allowing the Postal Service to raise prices.,Industry officials are also critical of the plan’s pivot toward the Postal Service’s package business and away from paper mail. DeJoy in the interview with The Post said he was “not a magician” and “I can’t create the need for mail.”,“In the entire fifty-eight pages of the plan there does not appear to be any effort to retain mail volume,” PostCom, a national postal commerce advocacy group, wrote in its Thursday industry bulletin. “Apart from price increases and service reductions, there is little about mail in the plan at all. That’s inaction.”,“This part of the plan will drive mail volume down to levels not seen since before it reached 100 billion in 1980,” the Alliance of Nonprofit Mailers wrote in its newsletter. “If we mailers win our federal lawsuit, the plan is sunk.”,Lawmakers are beginning to share that concern as they are bombarded with calls from local constituents worried about if their medications, paychecks and bills will arrive late. Already over the summer when DeJoy implemented a smaller round of service cuts, major mail-order pharmacies told Senate investigators that some patients experienced “significant” delays in receiving mailed prescriptions. In recent months, untold numbers of consumers have complained of late fees assessed on bills that were held up in the mail.,“This is the best way to kill your business,” Krishnamoorthi said, “which is to basically say to your customers, ‘We’re not going to meet your expectations. You’re going to meet our service realities, regardless of what ends up happening.’”",business
https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/03/26/wealthy-tax-evasion/,"The richest 1 percent dodge taxes on more than one-fifth of their income, study shows","The richest Americans are hiding more than 20 percent of their earnings from the Internal Revenue Service, ,, with the top 1 percent of earners accounting for more than a third of all unpaid federal taxes.,That’s costing the federal government roughly $175 billion a year in revenue, according to the findings by a team of economists from academia and the IRS.,The data comes as Senate Democrats , to reduce inequality and fund their legislative priorities.,President Biden, in a sharp reversal from his predecessor, has signaled that he wants to raise taxes on the wealthy, corporations and estates.,The researchers say that years of IRS funding cuts, combined with the increased sophistication of tax evasion tactics available to the rich, have made shirking tax obligations easier than ever. And they say that these estimates probably understate the true extent of tax evasion at the top of the income spectrum.,To catch tax cheats and measure evasion, the IRS randomly audits returns. But such reviews turn up very little evidence of evasion among the extremely wealthy, in part because the rich use sophisticated accounting techniques that are difficult to trace, such as offshore tax shelters, , and ,.,The IRS attempts to correct for this through a number of statistical methods. But the new study finds that even the IRS’s standard corrections underestimate the true extent of tax evasion among the rich.,The researchers were able to demonstrate this after the IRS and Justice Department initiated a crackdown on tax evasion in 2008. That effort led to the creation of the Offshore Voluntary Disclosure Program, which allowed taxpayers to disclose previously hidden offshore assets and pay a penalty in exchange for immunity from prosecution. According to the IRS, , before it shut down in 2018.,Hundreds of those taxpayers, as it turns out, had also been randomly audited before the creation of the program. The researchers matched those audits with the subsequent disclosures, and found that IRS auditors missed the offshore assets roughly 93 percent of the time.,These riches sheltered overseas, moreover, were concentrated almost exclusively among the very top earners.,The study also uncovered evidence of widespread underreporting of income among proprietors of pass-through businesses, whose revenue is taxed on their owners’ returns. “Up to 35% of the income earned at the top is not comprehensively examined in the context of random audits,” the authors found.,Factoring in underreporting from overseas tax shelters and pass-through businesses alone, the authors produced an estimate of the true distribution of tax evasion in the United States. Taxpayers in the bottom half of the income spectrum evade taxes on around 7 percent of their income. Among the top fifth of taxpayers, however, avoidance rises to around 10 percent.,But evasion peaks among the richest 5 percent, who have an income of at least $200,000 and who, as a cohort, capture more than one-third of total national earnings. Taxpayers in this group hide more than 20 percent of their income from tax collectors.,In total, nearly $1 out of every $12 earned in the United States is sheltered from federal income taxes because of the sophisticated evasion techniques of people earning more than $200,000 a year.,“The IRS needs a lot more resources from Congress,” said Daniel Reck, a lead author of the study, via email. He said the agency should “invest in more comprehensive examination strategies, involving audits of individuals, pass-through businesses, and other private entities (charities, trusts, etc.). It needs to hire and train large numbers of experts to conduct those more comprehensive examinations.”,“They can absolutely do all of this, but budget cuts have severely curtailed their ability to do it,” he added.,Since 2010, total funding for the IRS fell by about 20 percent, according to , by IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig. The number of enforcement staff employed by the agency fell 30 percent over the same period.,Those staffing cuts have, in turn, driven a sharp drop in audit rates, especially for wealthy taxpayers. In the mid-2010s, close to 30 percent of the returns of the richest 0.01 percent of taxpayers — those earning at least $10 million a year — were typically audited. By 2019, that number had fallen to well under 10 percent.,Steven Rosenthal, a tax policy expert at the Urban Institute who was not involved with the research, cautioned that tax return data from the pre-offshore crackdown era may be limited in terms of what it can tell us about evasion today.,“Since the 2000s, the IRS effectively shut down offshore accounts by aggressive enforcement, reporting, etc.,” he said via email. “And I do not see why we would expect taxpayers who used offshore accounts in the 2000s to migrate to other unlawful activity.”,But, Reck countered, “it would be a big mistake to claim that offshore evasion is virtually nonexistent in 2021.” To prove his case, he points to , claiming large banks continued to help wealthy clients stash money offshore after the crackdown, , criticizing the IRS for not pursuing offshore evasion aggressively enough, and the , Robert Brockman on tax evasion charges involving offshore holdings.,“People might have a harder time simply stashing wealth in Switzerland now, but they can still create complex networks of offshore and US entities and adopt ludicrously aggressive tax positions, like Brockman did,” Reck said.,Rosenthal also noted that the distinction between legal tax avoidance and illegal tax evasion gets extremely muddy at the top of the income spectrum, where billionaires such as Donald Trump employ teams of lawyers and accountants to push the limits of what the tax code allows — in Trump’s case, , on millions of dollars in income.,“Lowering your tax bill from many complicated structures is not clearly unlawful,” he said. “The IRS might win or lose in court,” or they might simply opt for a settlement somewhere in the middle.,“Hiring more agents would help,” he added. But, “the solution to this avoidance at the top end is write better tax rules.”",business
https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/03/03/democrats-stimulus-spending-inflation/,"In Democrats’ progressive paradise, borrowing is free, spending pays for itself, and interest rates never rise","Welcome, fellow Americans, to the era of the free lunch.,To hear it from liberal economists, progressive activists and Democratic politicians, there is no longer any limit to how much money government can borrow and spend and print.,In this new economy, we no longer have to worry that stock prices might climb so high, or companies take on so much debt, that a financial crisis might ensue. In this world without trade-offs, we can shut down the fossil fuel industry and transition to a zero-carbon economy without any risk to employment and economic growth. Nor is there any amount of infrastructure investment that could possibly exceed the capacity of the construction industry to absorb it.,Rest assured that the economy won’t miss a beat no matter how high or fast the minimum wage is raised. And whatever benefits are required by the always-struggling middle class can be financed by raising taxes on big corporations and the undeserving rich.,So party on, progressive dudes. Worries about debt and inflation are just ,20th-century, the figments of a now-discredited neoliberal imagination. We have entered a magical world where borrowing is costless, spending pays for itself, stocks only rise and the dollar never falls. In this economic paradise, government mandarins can fine-tune the economy to prevent inflation and unemployment, while economic, racial, environmental and social justice can be achieved without any painful trade-offs.,Okay, I exaggerate — but only slightly. I’ll be the first to admit that because of new technology and structural changes to the global economy, aspects of our economic understanding need to be updated. But those overdue correctives have been hijacked by partisans and ideologues who would have us believe that the laws of economics have been repealed.,It is undoubtedly true, for example, that in a globalized economy, the United States is less susceptible to , capacity constraints or a crowding-out of private borrowing by government borrowing. But that doesn’t mean that the government can borrow and spend an extra $10 trillion on,, infrastructure and climate investments without running a serious risk of overheating the economy.,Similarly, although , that governments can safely run higher annual budget deficits than previously thought, it’s also true that even a modest run-up in interest rates in a country as indebted as ours would saddle taxpayers with economically and politically painful levels of debt service.,Since the financial crisis of 2008, the , that it could avert financial panic and global depression by printing dollars and using them to buy government and corporate bonds. But what we should also have learned is that running the printing press at full tilt for years after the initial crisis has passed creates giant credit and investment bubbles that will burst at the first hint that the bond-buying is about to end.,All this borrowing and money-printing also risks triggering a run on the dollar and demands from foreign investors for higher interest payments on the $1 trillion they lend us each year just to maintain our current standard of living. Just because these things haven’t happened yet doesn’t mean that they won’t. And when they do, the unwinding will be swift and painful.,Or consider the current debate about the minimum wage. A thorough,strongly suggests that a higher minimum wage can lift millions out of poverty while causing fewer job losses than economic theory would suggests. But what you never hear from supporters of a $15-an-hour minimum wage is where the money will come from to give hefty pay raises — as much as 100 percent — to 27 million American workers, 1 in every 6. While a bit may come from higher worker productivity, most of the tab will be paid for by consumers in the form of higher prices, fellow employees in the form of lower raises and business owners in the form of lower profits. This is not just redistribution of income from the top 1 percent — it’s also redistribution from everyone else.,There is nothing magic, by the way, about $15 — it’s nothing more than a stretch goal chosen by grass-roots labor organizers.,If our goal is to restore the minimum wage to the purchasing power it had during the golden years of the 1960s and 1970s, then the right number would be something closer to,.,Alternatively, we could peg the minimum wage to the level necessary to bring a full-time worker above the poverty line. In that case, the current federal minimum wage of $7.25 would do the trick for a single worker, or $11 if you think a single parent with two children is the right reference point.,Or perhaps we should adopt the , standard calculated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology researchers, based on what it costs to provide the basic necessities enjoyed by most Americans. That would require a minimum wage ranging from $13 an hour for a single person to as high as $35 an hour in some states for a family of three.,My own preference would be to take our cue from the labor market and peg the minimum wage at half the hourly earnings of the median full-time worker, adjusted for regional variations. Nationally, that would average out to about $12.50 an hour, but would range from about $9 in a state such as Alabama to as high as $16 in California. Such a formula could win backing not just from a number of Republicans in Congress, but also from major business organizations. And yet if Democrats were offered the chance to pass such a deal tomorrow, it’s likely the pushback from progressives would be so loud that the White House and congressional leaders would turn it down.,The minimum wage, however, should not be considered in isolation. There is also broad bipartisan support for increasing and expanding the , — the government’s wage supplement for low-wage workers. And there is similar support for increases in the , and a refundable , When combined with food stamps and a fair minimum wage, these programs could effectively end poverty among working families in America.,My purpose in walking through this analysis is to point out that this is the kind of discussion that the country and Congress should be having at this moment — and that many of us hoped would happen with the arrival of a moderate, dealmaking president.,But what we have been treated to instead are mindless talking points (“Go Big”) politically inspired lines in the sand ($1.9 trillion in stimulus, a $15-an-hour minimum wage, $1,400 rebates) and transparently partisan proposals to reward the Democratic base, buy off White working-class voters and avenge the partisan outrages of the Trump era. Instead of bringing a polarized country together after a narrow election victory, Democrats seem determined to spike the football in the end zone.,It is disappointing, of course, that Democrats have embraced some of the same intellectual dishonesty, and the same all-or-nothing strategy, that they rightfully criticized when the Republicans were doing it. But what is equally disappointing is the performance my colleagues in the media, who relentlessly and heroically exposed the lies and exaggeration and false narratives of the Trump era but have suddenly lost their critical eye.,The extensive coverage of the $1.9 trillion relief package, for example, has been full of all the usual talking points and political posturing but has contained little about how these vast sums were arrived at or how the money would actually be distributed and spent.,Rare is the story these days that does not highlight how “progressives” feel about an issue, with nary a mention of what moderates or business leaders have to say.,Where is the three-, skepticism when the chair of the Federal Reserve assures that there is no connection between skyrocketing values for tech stocks and bitcoin and his pledge to continue pumping an additional $120 billion a month into the financial system?,And when was it decided that every economic issue or business practice is best viewed through the lens of race and gender?,Having written and edited my way through several of these economic and political cycles, I shouldn’t be surprised that the pendulum is now swinging too far in the other direction. But just as there is a danger in each new generation declaring that a new day has dawned and all the rules have changed, there is also a danger that those of the previous generation will fall into the trap of fighting the last war, offering up the same nostrums, and clinging too hard to outdated models of how the world works.,Back when I started at The Washington Post, there was a longtime reporter on the national desk who, whenever an editor would wander over to suggest he write a story about some issue in the news, would invariably reply, “We had it,” or “I already wrote that.”,In recent years, I’ve sometimes heard myself saying the same things to editors or readers who write in with a column suggestion. I find myself gravitating to the same topics, the same sources, even the same metaphors and sentence constructions. I’ve stubbornly declined to participate in social media, which for good or ill (mostly ill, I think) has now become an integral to the way journalists report what is happening, participate in the public conversation and let readers know what they’ve written.,These days my journalistic metabolism is better suited to a weekly magazine than the 24-7 news cycle, while my natural instinct to avoid writing about topics everyone else is writing about ignores the demanding realities of digital publishing. And in a polarized political and media environment, I am a reliable champion for neither tribe. It’s time to hang it up.,So this will be the last of my irregular columns for The Post. After 33 years, I’ve managed to outlast four executive editors, five managing editors and six business editors, and been lucky enough to work alongside hundreds of incredibly talented colleagues in a truly remarkable newsroom. I owe much to the countless economists, business and labor leaders, management consultants, politicians and public servants who have taken the time to tell me what they know and teach me about business and economics.,And it has been particularly satisfying to have been able to mentor so many young journalists who have gone on to become big stars in their own right. Most of all, it has been an honor and privilege to write for knowledgeable, discerning and appreciative readers who’ve never shied away from letting me know when I’ve gotten it wrong.,To all of you, thanks and farewell.",business
https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/03/18/tax-break-retirees-charitable-donations/,A tax break for retirees is back. Here’s how to use it — and what to avoid.,"Welcome to the height of tax prep season, with millions of people pressing to get their 2020 returns finished and filed.,But rather than talk about your 2020 taxes, let’s talk about a tax break for some of us that disappeared last year but is back in full force this year.,This break is a fringe benefit of getting old. It lets some of us (including me) in their 70s and up use a tax strategy that got canceled for 2020 because of covid but is now back with us.,I’m talking about qualified charitable distributions, which allow individual retirement account holders to divert some of their federally taxable required distributions to charity. That lets the IRA holders make donations and reduce their federally taxable income — while still letting them take the standard deduction on their federal tax returns.,QCDs, as they’re known, ,, when — thanks to Donald Trump’s 2017 tax law — the number of people itemizing deductions (including charitable contributions) began to fall sharply to the current 11 percent or so from the previous 31 percent, according to a table on the IRS statistics., on several occasions since I began using them myself three years ago. But this time around, I’d like to explain things in more detail. I’d also like to delve into some history and — with the aid of  Professor Christopher Hoyt, who teaches about taxation and retirement plans  at the University of Missouri-Kansas City Law School — explain the rationale behind some QCD rules that hadn’t made any sense to me.,As a bonus, I’ll also warn you about a potential problem Hoyt brought to my attention.,For those of us who qualify to make QCDs, they’re as close to a free tax lunch as you can get these days.,Let me explain.,Tax laws let people put tax-deductible dollars into “defined contribution” accounts such as IRAs, 401(k)s and 403(b)s. But when you reach the age of 72, you have to start taking federally taxable “required minimum distributions” from those accounts.,Those RMDs, as they’re known, make sense: You and your employer (if you had one) deducted the money that went into these accounts, so it seems fair for you to have to begin taking money out of those accounts and paying federal tax on it.,The size of your required distribution depends on your year-end retirement account balances and your age. For example, if you had $100,000 in your retirement accounts last Dec. 31 and you turn (or have turned) 75 this year, your RMD is about $4,370.,If you are 80, it’s about $5,350. At 85, $6,760. Those amounts are based on life expectancies, so the older you get, the bigger your required distribution gets.,(If you inherited a retirement account before 2020, you had to immediately begin taking taxable distributions regardless of your age and could start making QCDs when you turn 70-1/2. If you inherited it in 2020 or later, you generally have to empty the account within 10 years and pay tax on the proceeds, but you don’t have to take annual distributions.),Last year, QCDs ceased to be big tax savers because ,. You could still use QCDs to make contributions last year, but their big tax advantage — reducing your taxable income by offsetting distributions you were required to take — went into hibernation for the year.,But this year, required distributions have returned, and QCDs have got their tax mojo back.,QCDs exist because charitable groups lobbied for them. They were created — on a temporary basis — as part of the Pension Protection Act of 2006. QCDs became permanent in 2015 as part of the PATH — for Protect Americans from Tax Hikes — Act. One of the great legislative acronyms.,To make a QCD, you either cut a check from one of your IRAs to a charity, or else have your IRA administrator send you or the charity a check made out to the charity. You can make up to $100,000 of QCDs a year, but only to registered charities. You can’t send them to your own donor-advised fund.,You can make QCDs only from IRAs — not from 401(k)s or 403(b)s. I never understood why, but Hoyt told me it’s because Congress didn’t want to subject employer plans such as 401(k)s to even greater bookkeeping requirements than they already have.,You have to keep track of QCDs yourself. Your retirement plan administrators send tax forms — known as 1099-Rs — to the IRS showing your total distributions for the year. You or your tax preparer have to subtract those QCDs from your 1099-R income. The plan administrator doesn’t do that.,Why aren’t plan administrators required to put QCD numbers on your retirement income statements? Hoyt says that would require administrators to check every one of your QCDs to make sure it went to a registered 501(c) (3) charity. That would be a big, messy and expensive undertaking.,And now, to the problem, created — inadvertently — by the Secure Act of 2019, which allowed some people aged 70 ½ and up to make tax-deductible contributions to their IRAs.,The problem is that if you make tax-deductible contributions to an IRA that you’re using to make QCDs, it triggers a reduction in the amount of QCDs you’re allowed to deduct from your federally taxable income. It is, to use the technical tax term, a total hairball.,So if, like me, you’re making both QCDs and tax-deductible retirement account contributions, you’ve got to be careful not to trip over yourself.,Hoyt says the key is to make sure you’re not making QCDs from the same IRA into which you’re putting tax-deductible dollars. If, like me, you’re self-employed and have no employees, Hoyt says you can set up a solo 401(k) (which is what I’ve done) or a SEP-IRA and make deductible contributions to it. But, Hoyt warns, “avoid making QCDs from a SEP-IRA in the same year that you claimed an income tax deduction for contributing to the SEP-IRA."",Tax season isn’t fun. But if you’re part of the QCD world, next year’s tax season should be less painful than this year’s, because you’ll be able to see the benefit you got from making donations to charities you care about. That strikes me as a pretty nice deal.",business

It became a large-scale business, attracting boldface-name investors including Ted Leonsis and Steve Case.,Custom Ink encourages customers to go online and design T-shirts honoring family reunions, milestone events, businesses, philanthropies, sports teams, religious groups and more. Think 50 T-shirts emblazoned with “The Smith Family Reunion” or 150 baseball caps for the local 5K.,Then the , crisis hit in March 2020 and sales slid 80 percent within days. Like thousands of U.S. businesses slammed by virus shutdowns, Custom Ink had to figure out how to survive. It was forced to recalibrate and rethink its business as the pandemic took the world to a different place.,It was an especially difficult time for the business, which has shipped more than 125 million T-shirts. “Our business is driving social togetherness, family outings, school activities and occasions,” Katz said in a recent interview. “That hit a hard stop with social distancing. We had a huge challenge that was aimed at the heart of the business.”,In a note to his staff — known as Inkers — after the pandemic hit, Katz acknowledged the precipitous drop in sales and that the situation could not go on much longer.,“This is the email I’ve been dreading to write . . . and I’m sure you’ve been dreading to read,” he wrote. He warned that the company might need to “take major action both inside the company and with our investors and lenders to ensure we stay in business” and raised the specter of furloughs and dramatic cost-cutting.,Within days, Custom Ink furloughed around 75 percent of its 1,700 employees for at least two months. Senior leadership saw significant pay reductions.,It continued paying health insurance premiums for its furloughed team members, he said, and helped employees apply for unemployment benefits and access their retirement savings to see them through the crisis. Katz also offered interest-free advances and set up a hotline for employees.,“We tried to do the furlough as compassionately as possible,” Katz said.,That left the company with a skeleton staff to keep it going.,“There were so many questions about what’s going to happen in the economy and the world,” Katz said recently. “We had just seen our sales fall 80 percent in a week and a half. A week and a half!”,Except for the T-shirt printing teams in facilities in Nevada and Charlottesville, the company went virtual overnight. Complex functions ranging from marketing to customer service migrated out of its Fairfax, Va., headquarters and into employee homes.,Production facilities had to be supplied with safety gear. Protocols had to be instituted. Vendors had to be notified.,With the news filled with reports of medical shortages, especially N95 masks, Inkers had an idea — sell cloth masks to reduce the demand for medical-grade supplies.,Katz loved it. He had just read an interview with a Chinese researcher who promoted masks as a way to stop the spread of the coronavirus. At the same time, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention encouraged Americans to use cloth masks as a way to preserve the N95 masks for health-care workers.,“It sounds obvious now, but it wasn’t at the time,” Katz said. “We were ahead of the CDC. We lined up the first model of our mask, and by the time the CDC gave guidance, we already had the mask project going.”,Custom Ink took its T-shirt supply chain and turned it into a national distribution system for cloth masks. Tech teams worked round-the-clock to update the company’s site and fulfillment systems and sales. Marketing teams mobilized to offer new products to create revenue.,Every pandemic-related sales idea was on the table. Custom Ink sold work-from-home kits so client companies could help remote employees feel connected. They invented drive-by graduation gear for schools to share. Charitable T-shirt campaigns were updated to include a focus on the pandemic.,Katz said the company had to temporarily scrap its traditional marketing, which had been built around people throwing their arms around one another. “We adapted our marketing to new environments and to the safety messages people were consuming during the pandemic,” he said.,Custom Ink was soon delivering millions of cloth masks, with prices from $1 for a plain mask up to $8 for special designs.,Katz’s team made it so customers could go online and spice up their mask with colors, designs and logos. Custom Ink refined its products as it went, altering the masks for comfort, fit and style.,The marketing and technology teams built a free-standing “Mask for It” store to allow customers to express their personalities through their face coverings.,Katz declined to divulge hard numbers on mask sales, but he said they helped bridge the financial gap from the shutdown-related collapse in March to the gradual return of the core business over the spring and summer.,Over time, buyers shifted from generic cloth masks to custom masks with special colors and designs. Those went from a small fraction of unit sales in April 2020 to the majority of mask sales by midsummer, according to the company.,Mask revenue helped the company bring back its employees in August. Custom Ink is back to 1,600 Inkers.,“We lost about 10 percent of our team along the way because people moved to be closer to family,” Katz said. “The vast majority stuck with us.”,The company finished 2020 only slightly behind its original sales goals.,“It’s not as much as we otherwise would have made, but we turned a profit,” Katz said. “We were very determined to see the company through this, and we ultimately did.”,

The Bears lost the final in 1948 to Kentucky.,?,So it will be Cinderella — No. 11 seed UCLA, which won the most recent of its titles in 1995 — against three high seeds, each seeking a first national championship.,Nothing happened this week to change the minds of those who have thought since December that Gonzaga and Baylor ,.

The conference, touted by many as one of the great conferences of all time during the regular season, got nine bids — including two No. 1 seeds, Michigan and Illinois, and two No. 2 seeds, Iowa and Ohio State.,All of that led to an embarrassing 8-9 record in tournament games, with only Michigan even making the second weekend. So much for Big Ten hype.,The other often-hyped conference, the ACC, got seven bids, but none higher than Florida State and Virginia, both No. 4 seeds. Duke , — for the first time since 1995.

And yet the conference has one team in the Final Four and had two others — USC and Oregon State — in the Elite Eight. In all, the Pac-12 has gone 13-4 — and one of those losses was in an intra-conference matchup.,Houston, the No. 2 seed in the Midwest Region, had the easiest path to the final weekend.

While 42 percent of Americans are comfortable attending a live, ticketed sporting event in general — compared with 40 percent who are not and 18 percent who are unsure — people say their own comfort levels vary widely based on conditions.,About two-thirds say they would feel comfortable attending an outdoor event such as baseball (66 percent), but fewer than half as many (32 percent) feel comfortable attending an indoor event such as basketball. Nearly 2 in 3 people (64 percent) say they would feel comfortable if all attendees were required to wear masks, compared with 22 percent who would feel comfortable if there was no mask requirement.,In the poll, 63 percent of Americans say it is a large or moderate risk to attend a sporting event right now, including 26 percent who say it’s a large risk. That marks a sharp decline in risk over the past year: In a ,, 84 percent said attending a sporting event was a large or moderate risk, including 65 percent who said it was a “large risk.”,The Post-U.-Md. poll was conducted from March 12 to 18, as coronavirus infection rates started to plateau and vaccinations increased across the country. It was done online and included a random sample of 1,500 adult Americans, carrying a margin of error of plus or minus three points. The survey was conducted in collaboration with the University of Maryland’s Shirley Povich Center for Sports Journalism and its Center for Democracy and Civic Engagement.,Basketball and hockey teams have adjusted their attendance policies regularly in recent weeks as local conditions and restrictions have changed. Ten NBA and 15 NHL teams still don’t allow any spectators, though more are beginning to open their doors to limited crowds. Baseball is poised to begin its season with fans permitted in all 30 stadiums. After staging its entire 2020 regular season in empty ballparks, capacity limits this spring will range from 12 percent (Boston Red Sox) to 100 percent (Texas Rangers).,“Opening Day with fans in there is definitely going to be sick,” Manny Machado, the San Diego Padres all-star, said on a recent Zoom call with reporters. “It’s going to be awesome. I know everybody in here definitely can’t wait. I’ve been pumping it up. I’ve been saying it’s going to be the loudest 12- to 14,000, however many fans we have. … I’m getting goose bumps right now just thinking about it.”,To Americans, circumstances matter a great deal: They say outdoor events, mask requirements, strict attendance limits and personal vaccinations would make them feel more open to returning to stadiums.,More say they would be comfortable attending a stadium limited to 20 percent capacity (69 percent “comfortable”) than 50 percent capacity (50 percent). The vast majority of teams will open the season with seating capacity limits in the 15 percent to 30 percent range, which often means fewer than 10,000 fans will be on hand.,“You always want as many fans as possible,” Washington Nationals ace Max Scherzer said. “I love it when it’s sold out and the crowd’s rocking. Obviously, I get why we’re not going to have sold-out crowds. I get it. But, yeah, the more fans we can have, the better.”,Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said this week that masks should be mandatory at all games and urged teams to space out fans. But he said teams should base many protocols, such as permissible crowd size, on local conditions.,“It’s nice to think that we have a mathematical precision in figuring out what the right number is, but it’s just not true,” he said. “It really depends a lot on the level of infection in the community where the ballpark is located. You’re going to assume that the overwhelming majority of people that are going to show up at the ballpark are from the area where the ballpark is located.”,In the Post-U.-Md. poll, 54 percent of Americans say they’re comfortable attending sporting events if coronavirus case levels are low in the event’s region.,The Rangers are the only MLB team beginning the season at full capacity, as they look to show off their 40,000-seat new home. Globe Life Field opened last season in Arlington, Tex., without fans in attendance, which Texas Manager Chris Woodward likened to having “a brand-new car for a year that you couldn’t get out of the garage.”,Mask requirements at sporting events enjoy wide support, with roughly three-quarters of Americans overall and sports fans alike saying sports leagues should require attendees to wear them. However, that support dips to 56 percent among people who are currently comfortable attending live sports events. There is also a sharp partisan divide on the issue with 96 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents supporting a mask mandate at games, compared with 52 percent support from Republicans and Republican leaners.,Just as teams in different cities implement different protocols, fan sentiments vary by region, too. Americans in the Midwest are most comfortable attending a live sporting event (47 percent), compared with 42 percent in the South and in the West and 34 percent in the Northeast.,Still, just about,1 in 3 in the Midwest say they would be comfortable attending an indoor sporting event, half the share that would be comfortable at an outdoor one.,NBA and NHL teams have been hesitant to invite large groups to their games. Some cap attendance at 10 percent, which typically amounts to just a few thousand fans.,“It’s nice to have them, but you really don’t hear them much,” said Washington Wizards Coach Scott Brooks, whose team sees spectators only on the road. “ … It’s great to have fans. Even if it’s only 2,000, it’s better than nothing.”,Those teams are still sorting out appropriate protocols. For example, any ticket holder attending a Brooklyn Nets game is mailed a PCR test in advance and receives a rapid result on-site before allowed entry into Barclays Center. And as baseball opens its season, the New York Yankees and New York Mets are requiring proof of full vaccination or a negative coronavirus test before letting any fan into their stadium.,In the Post-U.-Md. poll, 56 percent of Americans say they’re comfortable attending live sporting events if attendees provide a negative coronavirus test, and nearly two-thirds of Americans say they would feel comfortable going to a sporting event after they have received a vaccine.,That dynamic hasn’t played out among Americans who have already received at least one dose, though. The poll finds Americans who have been vaccinated are more likely to feel uncomfortable attending at this time than unvaccinated adults, a pattern that may reflect the fact that vaccinated Americans are older and still express,concern about family members catching the coronavirus.",sports
https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2021/03/31/nationals-starting-rotation-scherzer-strasburg-corbin/,The starting rotation remains Washington’s foundation — and its greatest hope,"Every season since 2012, without exception, the fate of the Washington Nationals has been defined by the excellence, or the miseries, of its rotation. Those men are the team’s identity and most of its payroll, too.,Just one month ago, Max Scherzer, Stephen Strasburg, Patrick Corbin, Jon Lester and Joe Ross all looked like they might be the worst-case versions of themselves when the Nats opened their season Thursday night at home against the New York Mets.,Scherzer had just ,. Strasburg was coming back ,. Lester was, suddenly, ,. Ross was an unknown ,. Corbin was , last year.,Oh, brother.,With the Nats facing a brutal schedule over the season’s first six weeks, 2021 might be DOA in May. No wonder oddsmakers ranked the Nats only slightly above the middle of the MLB pack. After all, Washington’s rotation was next-to-, in ERA in the National League last year.,With pitchers in spring, as you ramp up from almost leisurely side sessions to 90-plus empty-the-tank pitches, things can change very quickly. It’s a danger zone. Some core staff members don’t survive that return to full-force pitching and are lost for months, or the year.,But some teams, with fingers crossed all the way, get to April with exactly the rotation they wanted, all in good health and throwing like the best versions of themselves that you could reasonably expect.,Right now, that’s the Nats. At least for one day. If nobody trips on a dugout steps during introductions.,Every pitcher comes with an “if.” Before April ends, the Nats’ starters’ ERA might be headed to infinity and beyond. After all, last year’s 5.38 mark was unspeakable.,Also, the season’s first three series — against the Mets, the three-time division champion Atlanta Braves and the , — would test any staff, much less one like the Nats that has only jelled recently.,But right now, I am anxious to see this rotation pitch — not in the sense of anxiety, but with anticipation. Yes, all five of them — Lester and Ross, too, about whom we will get big chunks of the truth very quickly in April.,How did all this happen and so quickly?,Early in training camp, Scherzer sprained his ankle, which set back his normal throwing program. For 36-year-old pitchers, that can be a red flag. Was he showing his age? Was he wise to push through discomfort and come back quickly?,The Mad Max approach worked. Scherzer’s recent starts have been decent, if less than dominant, and , — in a backfield game — got him near 100 pitches, with the last reportedly at 95 mph with a grunt.,At the start of camp, Strasburg was also lightly used because he was still , wrist surgery which ended his 2020 season after only two games. Docs said fixing carpal tunnel syndrome should be routine. But Strasburg and surgery are two words that don’t rhyme.,On Sunday and Monday, MASN finally deigned to televise the Nationals’ last two exhibition games of the spring. But they were instructive. Strasburg threw 98 pitches on Monday and, in his last two innings, found his mechanics and command, which had been rusty, and fanned the last three hitters he faced.,Since Strasburg had 83 pitches in his previous start, this key man, who might have been limited for weeks, is instead ready for full-go on Day One.,Perhaps the worst shock of early camp was news that Lester, ,, had such problems with low energy that he needed surgery to have a parathyroid gland removed. How long would that knock him out? Answer: ,.,Veteran lefties with elite pedigrees, as they lose velocity, sometimes adapt and become valuable back-end starters for a few years. So far, Lester looks much better than last year’s version of Aníbal Sánchez (6.62 ERA) and capable of a crafty, twice-through-the-order role, at the least.,The bigger question: After years of using 75-to-80 percent fastballs and cutters, can Lester adapt (like late career Tom Glavine, for example) to 40-to-45 percent off-speed pitches — in Lester’s case, curves and change-ups. If it works, he’s a steal at $5 million. If not, he still may be durable, gritty and a .500 pitcher.,Ross, after a very promising 12-10, 3.52 ERA start in his first two seasons, has been a mystery of major injury (,) and minor flaws, especially an inability to command more than his sinker and slider. In his last sharp outing, Ross used four pitches, including a change, touched 95 in his last inning and had 69 percent strikes. Don’t hold your breath, but this time … maybe.,Corbin in his last outing had the repertoire of the 2019 World Series season, though perhaps not quite as crisp. His fastball sat at 92-93, plus his usual wipeout slider, more change-ups and, in tune with the times, more top-of-zone challenge pitches, a tactic about which Max has been whispering in his ear.,Has the Nats rotation hits its form at the right time? Or is a steady diet of Mets, Braves, Dodgers and Cards about to hit them in the face for weeks on end? Get ready, because we’re probably going to find out a lot in a hurry.,In 2012, ’14, ’16, ‘17 and ’19, when the Nats won four NL East titles and a World Series, their starters finished first, first, second, third and second in NL ERA. In their other, poorer years, they were sixth, sixth, ninth and 14th.,Then, as now, several bullpens caused worry. But 'pens can be amended, and mended, in season. Rotations usually can’t. Also, this year, Erick Fedde and Austin Voth offer a bit of decent depth, plus bullpen usefulness, which will be needed, and tested, ,.,Washington has had , of post-world-championship celebration. Except for , almost exactly 17 months ago, there hasn’t really been one.,Last year was so blighted by the pandemic, and the Nats’ bad play, that much of MLB has forgotten how good the Nats were over the previous eight years. My hope for this year — in addition to playing all 162 games — is that the Nats give a decent account of themselves, worthy of the 2019 team, one that shows last year was a fluke.,That way, D.C. fans could, in steadily increasing numbers, go to Nats Park and enjoy the same kind of competitive, contending team that the Lerner family and GM Mike Rizo have built so consistently.,Right now, few around MLB predict such a thing. Vegas says third place, 84.5 wins and no playoffs. A month ago, I might have agreed. Now, I want the over.,The Nats are many things, but always “rotation first.” In 2019, Scherzer, Strasburg and Corbin , the first NL trio in 50 years to have 200 strikeouts each. Last year, they were 7-12 with a 4.43 ERA — a bunch of bums.,Many in MLB have written them off as a force. I don’t think the Big Three have evaporated at ages 36, 32 and 31. Stat projection sites — which only know the facts of their careers, not their names — say they will combined for 600 strikeouts this year. Lester and Ross look like upgrades behind them. Fedde, plus Voth offer reasonable depth.,Optimism is ,. But this time, though with normal April stomach flutters, it seems justified for the Nationals.",sports

The woman who loves to surprise others was about to get one herself.,Bill took the lead and said they never really got a chance to say congratulations for winning Big Ten coach of the year and the national honor from ESPN. However, he wanted to be the first to say congrats for being named AP national coach of year — as the team erupted in applause and Donna clapped and shook both hands in the air.,“We’re so darn proud of you,” Bill said on the AP produced video. “Almost makes you have tears in your eyes.”,The Maryland women’s basketball coach earned the honor for the second time after leading the Terrapins to a 26-3 record and the Sweet 16 of the NCAA tournament. She is just the fourth coach to win the award multiple times since its inception in 1995, joining UConn’s Geno Auriemma, Baylor’s Kim Mulkey and Notre Dame’s Muffet McGraw.,“An incredible surprise,” Frese said. “Family is so important for me. So, to pull off that surprise to have my parents share that with me. My entire family was on the Zoom. I was with my entire Maryland family, as well. You couldn’t have scripted that any more perfectly.,“I didn’t make a basket all year. This award is about your players and your team and your support staff really lining up as one.”,Maryland entered the 2020-21 season without its five starters from the 2019-20 Big Ten championship team and without five of its top six scorers. With five new starters, including two sophomores and two transfers, the Terps won the conference championship for the sixth time in seven years and Big Ten tournament title for the second year in a row. The team was the highest scoring team in the nation and set a program record averaging 90.8 points per game.,Frese became the , this season and surpassed 500 wins at the helm of Maryland. She has a 512-131 record and was , for the fourth time this season.,Frese also coached the season with a heavy heart as Bill continues to deal, in recent months.,Maryland entered the tournament as a No. 2 seed and the, to No. 6-seeded Texas. The Terps had won their previous 15 games, including five postseason games, by double digits. Maryland won its three Big Ten Tournament games by an average of 21 points and its first two NCAA tournament games by an average of 44.5 points.,“This one, obviously, is special for our team and for our program,” Frese said, “just because of everything we had to overcome as a team and obviously during this pandemic. I have just so much gratitude for an award like this because it’s not an award for me. It’s an award for your players and your staff.,“It was a season like no other. You look at the challenges. The fact that you couldn’t do it like you normally can. I’ve yet to have the team out to my home. You couldn’t do team building. … This sisterhood, this bond was created early over Zoom, ironically. … I think it speaks volumes to this team, just their talent level.”,Svrluga: ",sports
https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2021/03/31/anthony-fauci-sports-stadiums-fans/,"For Anthony S. Fauci, going to a ballgame is ‘the one fun thing I can’t wait to do’",": There were no fans allowed at baseball games last year during the regular season, but a lot has changed since then. Are you comfortable with spectators attending games in person right now?,: I think that what we’re going to be seeing as the season progresses and as we get more and more people vaccinated and the level of infection comes down in the community, there will be more flexibility in getting more and more people into the ballpark. Hopefully by the time we get in the full swing of the season, there’ll be a lot more people that could feel comfortable being in the ballpark. I mean, obviously, there will still be the masking requirement. There will still be spaced seating.,One of the things we have going in our favor is that every day we vaccinate in this country, close to 3 million people every single day. And the more people that get vaccinated, the less likely it is that you’re going to have an issue. Now, obviously, we are still concerned that the rate of infection in the country is still quite high. It’s still plateaued now at somewhere between [55,000] and 65,000 new infections per day, which is quite high.,However, if we continue to implement the public health measures that we talk about all the time — the wearing of masks, the avoiding congregate settings, particularly indoors, the washing of hands — and as more and more people get vaccinated, I think there’s going to be more and more flexibility and greater attendance at places like [Nationals Park].,: To start, the Washington Nationals are among the teams that will have only a few thousand people allowed in attendance —,: Whatever they start off with, I think it’s going to get better and better as we get into the season. And then hopefully by the time we’re into the season, we’ll even have a great deal of flexibility and more and more people.,: A recent Washington Post-University of Maryland poll found 2 in 3 Americans say they’re comfortable attending an outdoor event such as baseball, but fewer than half say they’re comfortable going to an indoor event such as basketball. Is it safe to assume those concerns are warranted?,: There’s a big difference between indoor and outdoor. We know that from experience that when you’re in a place like [Nationals Park] and particularly if you’re well spaced and you’re seating and you’re wearing a mask, the chance of spreading infection is extraordinarily low. Outdoor is clearly far, far safer than indoors because of the recirculation of air indoors. Whereas outdoor, you know, you have a dilution with the entire environment, so that’s why the risk is so much lower in an outdoor [setting]. That’s why stadiums like [Nationals Park], if you have an appropriate, prudent spacing of people, the risk is very low.,: In the poll, 64 percent of people said they would be comfortable attending if everyone was required to wear a mask. Even at outdoor events with spacing in the stands, do you think masks should be considered mandatory?,: Yeah.,: Baseball stadiums will have a wide range of attendance capacities — from 12 to 100 percent, with many closer to 20 to 25 percent. Is there a magic number?,: It’s nice to think that we have a mathematical precision in figuring out what the right number is, but it’s just not true. It really depends a lot on the level of infection in the community where the ballpark is located. You’re going to assume that the overwhelming majority of people that are going to show up at the ballpark are from the area where the ballpark is located.,The judgment of what percentage of capacity you’re going to have is likely going to be influenced by what the level of baseline infection is in the community surrounding and the geographic area of the ballpark.,: It stands to reason that baseline number will be different everywhere, so we will see different attendance limits throughout the season. But one team is opening the season at 100 percent capacity. What do you make of that?,: What team is that?,: The Texas Rangers in Arlington.,: Really? Well, that’s interesting. I don’t want to be critical of that, but that’s — I would not start off with 100 percent capacity. But, you know, Texas has been always a bit more — what’s the right word? — daring when it comes to the kinds of things that they want to do in regards to this outbreak.,: On the other end of the spectrum, the New York Yankees and New York Mets are requiring proof of a full vaccination or a negative coronavirus test for every ticket holder. Should that be mandatory?,: I don’t really want to pass judgment, because then I get pitted against entire organizations. So, I mean, everybody has their own way of doing things. One of the ways is to require a negative test or proof of vaccination. I’m not saying that’s a bad idea, but it’s going to vary. As you said, some ballparks are allowing 100 percent capacity. Some want to start off at 10 to 20 percent capacity. And because everybody does things independently, you’re going to have a great variety of requirements that people are going to have. And one of them might be a negative test and proof of vaccination.,: You mentioned the importance of people maintaining their distance. Many teams are offering only cashless transactions at concession stands. Does that feel necessary to you?,: That’s a creative way. Any way you can diminish personal interaction with someone that’s not a member of your own family, I think, would be a step toward more safety. So anything that’s creative, including — because we know that when people go to the concession stands, that’s when people are close and that’s where the risk increases. So anything that can minimize the risk in that environment, I think, would be a positive.,: The baseball season is obviously long. How do you see stadium restrictions evolving in the coming months?,: I hope that as we get into the late spring, early summer, that we get more people vaccinated. Every day you’re going to get up to 3 million people in this country vaccinated. The more people that get vaccinated, the safer it is for everyone. I would hope that as we get into the late spring and early summer that you’re going to have a lot more flexibility on people in the stands.,: The NBA and NHL playoffs will get going before summer — May and June. Is it possible those will be safer to attend in person?,: It’s going to really depend on the level of infection in the community. That really is the determining factor. If the infection numbers go way down as more people get vaccinated, there can be more flexibility indoors.,: What about you? We’ve all heard about your affinity for the sport — will you be attending a baseball game any time soon?,: My life has just been completely dominated by response to this outbreak, but if you’re asking me what’s the one fun thing I can’t wait to do, it’s to go to [Nationals Park] and watch the team.,: You went last year. Are you eager to have a do-over at the first pitch?,: I don’t know about that. But I certainly am going to be rooting for them, that’s for sure.,: So no first-pitch plans?,: Not right now.",sports

https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2021/03/31/nationals-defense-josh-bell-starlin-castro/,These Nationals have plenty of strengths — and at least one glaring weakness,"Opening Day is virtually synonymous ,. But man, am I worried about the Washington Nationals’ defense.,There is so much to like about what the Nationals ,, identifying their holes early and aggressively moving to fill them, a signature of ,, now entering its 13th season. They needed to lengthen the lineup to provide more threats than just Juan Soto and Trea Turner, so , and the , made perfect sense. They needed another veteran starter after the departure of Aníbal Sánchez, so ,. With Sean Doolittle’s ,, they needed a left-hander in the bullpen, preferably one who could close, so they welcomed Brad Hand, ,.,Check, check, check, check. There was solid logic behind each move.,And yet, when the Nationals take the field Thursday night at Nationals Park to open the season — in front of , — they will need at least 27 outs to beat the New York Mets. I shudder at how many times this team might give the opponent 29 outs. Or 30. Or more.,You can win a single baseball game that way, washing away defensive lapses with offensive outbreaks or overpowering pitching. But over the course of a season — which, thankfully, will be , this year — those extra outs add up and wear you down.,“We got to get 27 quick outs,” Manager Dave Martinez said earlier in spring training. “We talk about it all the time. We can’t give these teams 28, 29, 30 outs, because if that happens, some of these [National League East] ,. We got to make sure to limit our mistakes.”,A sound philosophy — but a limited roster. Look around the field and identify a position at which the Nationals have an above-average defender., ,? Athletically, he has the range and the arm strength — yet he’s coming off a shortened 60-game season in which he was sloppy on defense, which had him saying this headed into spring training: “Obviously, the defense, I’d want to work on.”,Victor Robles in center? Again, the speed and range are there. But he played the 2020 season with a body that had bulked up too much, and instead of being fluid he was stiff. Metrics will tell you ,, not above, and while he has the ability to change that, he has to do it across the course of this summer.,And then … uh, no. There isn’t even another candidate. Soto is moving to right field full-time for the first time in the majors, so while the club can be optimistic, there’s a definite TBD factor there. Starlin Castro will , than the man he beat out for the job, ,, but in his long career, he has played more than 7,400 innings at shortstop and more than 4,900 at second base — but just 366⅔ at third. Anthony Rendon he is not.,Josh Harrison is on this team , — he can play second, third, left or right. But Kieboom’s struggles and subsequent start at Washington’s alternate site leave Harrison as the most frequent second baseman. That’s fine on a given night, middling over the course of a year. Of the 21 players who have logged at least 2,500 innings at second base over the past five seasons, Harrison is in the middle of FanGraphs’ defensive runs above average metric — 12th. Same for catcher Yan Gomes over that time period with that same minimum of innings — 15th of 29.,Schwarber was a catcher in college who learned to play the outfield as a pro, and he’s actually better than you think — 12th of 34 left fielders with more than 1,000 innings played over the past four years. Martinez, who helped teach Schwarber outfield play when both were with the Chicago Cubs, believes Schwarber is underrated in how quickly he gets to balls and how good his arm is when he gets there — and the metrics back him up. He’s not going to win a Gold Glove, but he won’t kill you out there.,But let’s get to the real problem: Bell. With six homers and a whopping 1.328 on-base-plus-slugging percentage this spring, , to provide more thump behind the wunderkind Soto. But to be effective for the 2021 Nats, he might have to adopt the philosophy of former Washington slugger/sage Adam Dunn: drive in more than you let in.,Bell is a candidate to be the worst defensive first baseman in the game. A strong candidate. Embrace that knowledge now, before you expect more from him. The , — and damning.,Of the 32 first basemen who have played at least 1,500 innings at the position since 2017, Bell ranks 30th in defensive runs saved (DRS), a metric originally developed by John Dewan of “The Fielding Bible,” which measures how much a player is above or below average at a specific position. Unfortunately, DRS is where Bell rates ,.,In ultimate zone rating (UZR), which attempts to calculate how many runs a player saves or costs his team, Bell ranks 32nd at minus-18.2. That’s bad. What’s worse: The next-worst first baseman over those four seasons is Houston’s Yuli Gurriel at minus-6.6. (By contrast, Oakland’s Matt Olson leads the majors at 21.4 in that span.) In the defensive runs above average metric, which makes it easier to compare defensive contributions across positions, Bell is also 32nd by a mile: minus-50.9, while no one else is worse than minus-40.4.,So Bell is the Mike Trout of poor defensive first basemen — an outlier. The situation is such that when the Nats lead late in games, veteran Ryan Zimmerman will be the defensive replacement. Zim can still pick it, and he ,. But when they X-ray his right shoulder these days, what’s revealed is sawdust and glue. Washington’s better defensive option is a guy who physically has trouble throwing.,The potential problem with a leaky defense as a weakness is it’s tied directly to what’s supposed to be Washington’s strength. This is a team that is built on its starting pitching — on preventing runs.,So here’s the scenario I can’t shake: There are two outs in the sixth. Max Scherzer uncorks his 90th pitch. The hitter makes contact. Pick an outcome: It falls just in front of Soto in right. It’s an easy grounder, but Bell can’t scoop out a throw in the dirt. It barely eludes Castro or Harrison. It sends Turner into the hole at short, but he doesn’t trust Bell enough to leap and unleash a laser across the infield, so he eats it.,None of those are errors. All result in Scherzer — or Stephen Strasburg, or Patrick Corbin, or Lester — to push 100 pitches or more to escape the frame. They impact the bullpen usage and the outcome on a given night, which affects who’s available the next night, which has an impact that builds — and wears — on a team over the course of months.,Get excited for this season, because the characters the Nationals have assembled have personality and pop. But in firing yourself up, be aware of the team’s deficiencies on defense, because they’re real. Then give thanks for those nights when all the Nats grant the other team is the 27 outs needed to win.",sports
https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2021/03/31/william-jackson-fit-washington-defense/,How new cornerback William Jackson III fits into Washington’s defense,"The Washington Football Team’s search for cornerback depth escalated to an urgent need this offseason when Ronald Darby agreed to a three-year, $30 million contract with the Denver Broncos. Already thin in the secondary, Washington was suddenly down to one starting cornerback with few obvious options in an inflated free agent market.,But Washington quickly addressed the position by ,, and the move could prove to be one of its most impactful of the offseason.,“Not enough people know about him because he played in Cincinnati,” former Washington safety and current ESPN analyst Ryan Clark said. “Cincinnati stinks. When you look at a team and they’re not good, you’re not necessarily looking at the individual pieces for what they’re doing.”,With speed (4.37-second 40-yard dash at the NFL combine), size (6-foot, 196 pounds) and ball skills, Jackson has the physical tools coveted at the position. His career numbers (only three interceptions in 59 games) fail to depict an elite cornerback, but they also fail to tell the whole story. He was targeted in coverage on only 14.1 percent of pass plays over the past three years, the fourth-lowest rate among starting cornerbacks who played at least 2,000 snaps in that span.,“I just tell them to watch the tape,” Jackson said. “I wasn’t getting thrown at a whole lot. … When you’re covering guys up, you don’t get many picks.”,Clark said he believes Jackson is on the cusp of becoming more of a household name, and Washington’s defense, led by its talented line, could help him get there. Washington jumped from the bottom five to the top five in most major categories in coordinator Jack Del Rio’s first season with the team.,“Every cornerback that has played under [Del Rio] has had successful years,” Jackson said. “He’s a coach that knows exactly what he’s doing. Every corner succeeds in his defense. I’m just here to succeed and make it better.”,Just how will Jackson fit in Del Rio’s 4-3 scheme?,With the Bengals, Jackson played primarily press-man coverage, sticking to opponents’ No. 1 receivers much as he did against Terry McLaurin in Washington’s win over Cincinnati last year. The Bengals, ,, played man coverage, or cover-one with a single-high safety, at the eighth-highest rate in the league. Washington, by comparison, was in man coverage only 21 percent of the time, 21st most in the NFL.,That Del Rio used more zone than man has led some to ask whether Jackson will face a challenge in transitioning to the scheme or whether Del Rio might make alterations to it based on Jackson’s arrival.,But the notion of “fit,” especially for defensive backs, requires context. NFL defenses, no matter the scheme, run a mix of man and zone, often in the same play. When Wade Phillips was defensive coordinator of the Denver Broncos, he described his team’s coverage as a “matchup zone” because it used both man and zone coverage simultaneously.,“We say, ‘Hey, you’re playing this zone, but when a guy comes over there, you match with him,’ ” ,. “ ‘You pass it off, just like in basketball. When another guy comes there, you go there.’ We play a lot of match zone, but people think we’re playing man-to-man. Hopefully that confuses them.”,Washington employed similar tactics last year, not just with its scheme but also the technique of its cornerbacks.,Take Washington’s ,, when Kendall Fuller intercepted Jared Goff in the second quarter. Before the snap, Washington appeared to be in man coverage but was actually in a cover-two scheme. Fuller lined up wide, across from wide receiver Cooper Kupp. When Kupp began his route inside, Fuller turned his head as if he planned to follow, then quickly turned to the quarterback and sunk back in coverage between Kupp and the slot receiver, where he made the interception.,It’s plausible Del Rio could tweak his playbook to capitalize on Jackson’s strengths as a press-man cornerback, though neither he nor anyone else in Washington has indicated that. If anything, Jackson’s abilities give the team more options and versatility in the defensive backfield.,Although Fuller was used primarily outside last season, he has played all over the secondary in his career. So, too, has cornerback Darryl Roberts, , who last played in Detroit. The addition of Jackson could free up both to move around to the slot, outside or even free safety in certain coverages.,“Where you sometimes lose the value of a player is when you say, 'Okay, we’re paying him this, so we’re going to make him do all of these things,’ ” Clark said. “Nah, the thing that made you pay him, you should probably let him do that as much as you possibly can. … Let [Jackson] play corner. Let him follow the number one [receiver] if you want. Maybe Kendall can slide inside at times. [Jackson] gives you an opportunity to move people around and do some different things schematically because of his man skills.”,Del Rio has worked with a number of cornerbacks who had previously played more man coverage elsewhere and found success in his scheme. Included in that group is Aqib Talib, who while playing for Del Rio in Denver in 2014 had four interceptions, including two returned for touchdowns, plus career highs in passes defensed (16) and tackles for loss (three).,Darby was another who played mostly man coverage before signing with Washington. Last year in Del Rio’s scheme — and in the first season he was fully healthy — Darby recorded a career-high 16 passes defensed and was lauded by Coach Ron Rivera as the team’s “most consistent” cornerback.,Clark said transitioning to a new scheme can come with challenges, but the more difficult switch is for a zone cornerback who is asked to play more man coverage.,“You already know [Jackson] has the requisite skill-set to play the position, period,” Clark said. “When you can do those things, fitting a guy into cover-two or fitting a guy into cover-three or fire zones, which are things run heavily by Jack Del Rio, those things can be done rather than trying to turn a guy who’s a primary zone corner into a press-man guy. … You allow good players to fit into your scheme, and then you use their special traits when needed.,“Darrelle Revis fit into the New England Patriots’ scheme. When they played really good number one receivers, they moved him on the number two [receiver] and doubled the number one. So they give you more schematic flexibility, but you still are going to be who you are at the core.”,At its core, Washington is led by its defensive line, a group that boasts four first-round draft picks, including reigning defensive rookie of the year Chase Young. ,, Washington had the third-highest pass-rush win rate (50 percent) last season, creating trouble for opposing quarterbacks but an incentive for cornerbacks such as Jackson.,“It’s just a blessing to have that front,” Jackson said. “We’ve got a lot of great guys up front. The quarterback’s not going to be able to hold the ball. When we were making the decision, it was very easy because of the front that we have. The defense is already very good. I’m just a piece to make it better.”",sports

In public, Deshaun Watson is a brilliant, blinding superstar: ,, pristine reputation, charming persona, ,. Yet he now ,, among many alleged sins against massage therapists, of being a “serial predator.”,It’s the most uncomfortable sports story in a time of uncomfortable sports stories, and with each passing day, the accusations gain heft. For two weeks now, , against the Houston Texans quarterback have ,, surfacing one, three, seven claims at a time. Nineteen lawsuits ,. There is zero chance now this scandal bows to Watson’s fame and just goes away.,We’re a long way from clarity about whether Watson is innocent or guilty, whether we knew him as well as we imagined before the lawsuits rained down. We don’t know whether these civil cases could lead to a criminal investigation. We’re even less certain of how the Texans — the bumbling franchise Watson doesn’t want to play for anymore — and the NFL will proceed.,But we must watch. We must look at all the dimensions of this scandal, no matter how disturbing. We cannot pretend this isn’t happening or this will blow over. And even though the world knows Watson, while his accusers are anonymous, we cannot use that as permission to be callous. Watson has all the resources provided by celebrity and wealth. His accusers have legal representation and their stories. They deserve our attention and a sincere vetting.,Let’s get the stardust out of our eyes.,Everything about this escalating situation makes you cringe. For many sports fans, the instinct is to run from it as quickly as possible. For me, the trepidation isn’t limited to utter shock and the sensitivity of the subject matter. No, there’s something more worrisome: a sense that this will be a messy and drawn-out process that sends another terrible message about how the NFL, and the rest of the male-dominated sports world, deals with female claims of abuse.,Unless all the women admit to lying, it’s hard to imagine a scenario in which Watson can be redeemed easily. The charm of his story almost certainly is over, dead. What’s left remains to be seen.,That’s a difficult notion to grasp because, just last month, Watson seemed he was coming into his own at age 25 and doing so impressively. He wasn’t just an elite quarterback. He was , between NFL superstars and team ownership. His , was going to be ,. Now, when having to think about his career, you are inclined to look away.,On Monday, Sports Illustrated published , about a woman not tied to the 19 filings of Texas lawyer Tony Buzbee. The independent reporting cast doubt on theories of a conspiracy. But more than that, I keep thinking about one quote from the latest anonymous massage therapist to come forward.,The woman said to SI’s Jenny Vrentas: “There are so many people that are against us, saying: ‘Why would he do that? He has no reason to do that. He has a beautiful girlfriend; he has this, this, this and this.’ All those things are true, but fame doesn’t create character.”,And anonymity doesn’t authorize mistrust.,Well, it shouldn’t. But that’s a common escape hatch for the accused, and sports figures access it frequently. And here we are, threatening to allow it again. All these years of bad experiences, all this recurrence of abusive tales, all this shame, and we have learned almost nothing about balancing due process for celebrities with the need to protect possible victims. The court of public opinion makes this difficult to do, and lawyers, agents and managers have every right to mount a vigorous defense. But the societal standards for the way we discuss these cases must be elevated, particularly in sports, where men and male attitudes occupy so much space.,At the start of the Watson scandal, his agent defended him on Twitter. David Mulugheta is young, bright and rising quickly in the business. His effort to redirect the conversation about Watson was lazy and dangerous, however. Even worse, it was easy for Watson’s supporters to cling to mindlessly.,“Sexual assault is real,” ,. “Victims should be heard, offenders prosecuted. Individuals fabricate stories in pursuit of financial gain often. Their victims should be heard, and those offenders also prosecuted. I simply hope we keep this same energy with the truth.” Just once, it would be nice if we avoided doing that dangerous, soulless sports and celebrity thing during a situation like this. It would be revolutionary if we didn’t reduce it to a , said/she said conversation in which the accused perversely shares victimhood with the accusers. There is a way to be fair to Watson, to scrutinize the story as it develops but reserve final judgment for later, without shrinking the alleged victims down to gold-digger status.,The legal process is its own sideshow. Buzbee, who lives in the same neighborhood as Texans owner Cal McNair, is known for his flamboyance. As the attorney for the plaintiffs, he seems to be maximizing the rollout of these lawsuits, breaking news nearly every day while hinting that there’s more to come. Rusty Hardin, Watson’s lawyer, , of creating a “circuslike atmosphere by using social media to publicize” the lawsuits. Hardin considers the effort to be “calculated to inflame the public and malign Deshaun’s otherwise sterling reputation.”,Then Hardin went after Buzbee for keeping all of the plaintiffs anonymous.,“In addition, the tactic of refusing our requests to confidentially provide the names of the plaintiffs so we can fully investigate their claims makes uncovering the truth extremely difficult,” he said. “Anonymity is often necessary as a shield for victims, but opposing counsel has used it as a sword to publicly humiliate Deshaun before the truth-seeking process can even begin.”,When the lawyers start posturing, it seems as if the women — the massage therapists who say they couldn’t do their jobs without Watson trying to sexualize the experience — are mere instruments in the fight. For too much of the time, the prevailing story line shifts from the famous Watson’s future to the prominent lawyers’ audacious tussle. All the while, the women are in the background, hoping to stay anonymous but still be seen.,Let’s get the stardust out of our eyes.",sports

According to a person familiar with the proceedings, the vote was unanimous.,Documents presented during the owners’ virtual meeting indicated that the $875 million sale is expected to close this week and will terminate all disputes among Snyder and his co-owners, according to a person familiar with the situation.

That resulted in a dispute over whether Snyder was entitled to exercise such rights in a selective manner.,Instead, Snyder will tighten his control over the franchise that he purchased from the Jack Kent Cooke estate in 1999. According to court documents, Snyder currently owns 40.459 percent of the team.

Add in the trade deadline in mid-April and these next few weeks will be a strong indicator for where the team is at as it nears its looming playoff push.,Four of the five meetings against the Islanders will be at Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum, including the Capitals’ next game on Thursday night. The Capitals are 3-0-0 against the Islanders this season. New York is on a two-game losing streak, falling to the Penguins twice.,“They’ve been tight games [against the Islanders], there is not a lot of room out there to create and so we will have to work for that,” Laviolette said. “We will have to work to defend hard, but I think the guys know it is important games, it is big games, as they have been.

Washington has won 15 of its past 18 games and have managed to keep its game-changing mistakes to a minimum with a depleted lineup.,“There is always mistakes out on the ice but when they lead to breakaways or guys point blank in front of the net, those are the tough ones,” Laviolette said. “I don’t think we’ve been guilty of a lot of those big mistakes lately but [Tuesday] it caught us. It was a difference in the game.”,While there are positives still to be gleaned from Tuesday’s mishap, Laviolette said he sometimes finds it hard to keep that broad outlook in the moment.,“I probably don’t keep that perspective very well,” Laviolette said. “I was angry last night on the bench, you know when a team is capable and you know how they are capable of playing and I guess you always want to try to play to that standard.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2021/03/25/ncaa-women-basketball-tournament-revenue/,The NCAA’s shell game is the real women’s basketball scandal,"The NCAA’s , is either malpractice or malfeasance. It’s one or the other. The issue is not just petty skimping on food, the ,, the willful lack of promotion. Something much bigger is going on here, a kind of larceny. And Congress should make the NCAA crack open the books on it.,Short of stifling Geno Auriemma with a pillow while stealing his diamond championship rings, the NCAA could not work harder to smother the potential of the women’s tournament and rob it of revenue. This week, in response to a query about its financials, the NCAA insisted again that the women don’t turn a profit. This is patently unjustifiable. You know how much revenue NCAA Division I women’s basketball generated collectively in 2018-2019? Almost a billion dollars. That’s according to economist Daniel Rascher, a financial analyst for the firm OSKR who studied the NCAA’s self-reported numbers and testified as an expert in the governing body’s ,. “I don’t see how they lose money on it,” he says.,You know how many companies will advertise on ESPN during this women’s tournament, brands that want to be associated with the elegance of stars such as , and Stanford’s Kiana Williams, who play the game like strings of silk? A total of 77, among them Verizon, Chevrolet, L’Oréal and Nike.,You know how many viewers watched ,? More than 3.68 million, with a peak of 5.6 million in the closing minutes of Baylor’s one-point victory over Notre Dame. Know what that’s comparable to? A Wimbledon men’s final. Game 1 of the 2019 National League Division Series between the Washington Nationals and Los Angeles Dodgers. LeBron James’s debut with the Los Angeles Lakers. Hannity.,So if the NCAA can’t come out ahead on an ESPN championship with millions of viewers, which is it? Incompetence or indifference?,Someone on Capitol Hill should snatch NCAA President Mark Emmert by the lapel and demand that he explain his math. What is the NCAA counting — and more importantly, not counting — when it insists the women’s tournament “does not generate any net revenue?” Asked his opinion of this contention, marketing analyst Tony Pace laughs out loud. Pace is the former chief marketing officer for Subway and now president of the Marketing Accountability Standards Board. “My impression is that you can do a lot of funny things with cost accounting,” he says.,The revenue discussion is “pejorative,” Pace says. “First of all, they are revenue-producing.”,The NCAA is playing three-card monte. There is no question ratings for early round women’s games can be negligible, especially when aired piecemeal on ESPN’s substations, which means lower ad pricing and revenue. Nevertheless, watch any women’s tournament game on ESPN’s channels, and you’ll see prominent title sponsor placements for AT&T, Capital One and Coca-Cola. The lineup of commercial breaks includes State Farm, Liberty Mutual and Kentucky Fried Chicken, among others. Pricing in media buys is always a complex calculation, dependent on time slot and event cachet, but these companies did not pay nothing. This is a Disney-owned network we’re talking about. ESPN made the decision to expand coverage and air all 63 games nationally this year, presumably because it knew it could sell ads against it.,According to Jim Minnich, senior vice president of sports revenue management for Disney Advertising Sales, the ad prices for the women’s tournament are “comparable” to events with similar-sized audiences. As for the tournament as a whole, “We’ve been very happy with its performance from both a demand and audience standpoint,” he says.,Dodge. Crest. Bounty. M&Ms. Dunkin’.,What’s remarkable is that the women’s event has managed to grow at all in the face of neglect. The NCAA doesn’t even devote decent floor decals to the women’s games, decals that denote this is a championship event. Live-apps, interactive brackets and updates are interest-drivers that “build the business,” Pace says, and not having them included with the “NCAA March Madness” campaign suppresses the audience. Still, of the women’s 77 advertisers this year, 17 are new. “That’s a really good number,” Pace says.,Dairy Queen. Chevron. Peloton. Cisco.,Just watch the ads. How on earth does the NCAA justify this slurring of women as dead weight? The NCAA men’s tournament, with its $19 billion, multiyear deal with Turner-CBS is, of course, gargantuan — but that doesn’t account for the disproportionality. How is it that a supposed educational nonprofit gives a men’s team that wins a single tournament game a revenue-share payout of $2 million, while the team that wins an entire women’s championship — that is also “presented by Capital One” — gets not a cent?,Here’s how they work it. The NCAA has a fistful of colossal sponsorship and media deals. ESPN paid $500 million for a TV pact that bundles the women’s tournament with 24 championships. Then there is the NCAA Corporate Champions and Partners Program, a massive agreement for dollars and services with AT&T, Capital One and Coca-Cola. A lower tier includes 15 more corporate “partners” such as Marriott and Nabisco.,What is the value assigned to women’s basketball in all of this? The NCAA is opaque, perhaps deliberately. “Part of the issue is that they blend the revenues from the media deals,” Rascher points out. When you start pulling at threads, you find the NCAA has a highly flexible definition of “costs,” amid a tangle of revenue streams, unallocated funds, resources and values-in-kind. During discovery in the antitrust cases, Rascher found that the NCAA’s bookkeeping claims “depend on the story they’re telling,” he says.,The story the NCAA has long told to women’s basketball is this: It is a cost burden, a subsidized sport “that should feel lucky to be there,” Rascher says.,As long as the NCAA can make the women’s basketball tournament seem “net” poor, nobody will bother much about it, right? It makes it harder for women’s coaches to campaign for budgets and revenue shares, and for female stars such as Paige Bueckers to argue that they deserve to be paid. And it makes it easier for campus administrators, 83 percent of whom are White men, to continue to pour money into funhouse opulence such as ,.,This is behind , at the women’s tournament in San Antonio this week. For 40 years they’ve been told by male officials, “If only you paid your own way.” So they built a championship from scratch, an in-demand television event with enormous potential. And what do they get for it? They get used as a write-down, put down in the ledgers as “losers” no matter how much they win, and have to suffer the mansplaining of Emmert while they’re at it.,Emmert , to get to the bottom of the “blunders” that led to disparate treatment of the women’s tournament. But to get to the bottom of it, just go straight to the top. No one has been a bigger perpetrator of this shell game lie than Emmert. The NCAA spends a gazillion dollars on all kinds of , expenses, including his $2.7 million compensation, and then claims the, generate “no net revenue?” This is not real accounting.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2021/03/31/evan-mobley-nba-draft/,What NBA front offices are saying about Evan Mobley as a top draft prospect,"Evan Mobley’s sensational freshman season and strong NCAA tournament run for Southern California abruptly ended in the Elite Eight on Tuesday, when ,.,For the 7-foot Mobley, there was no shame in losing this showdown with Jalen Suggs. Gonzaga’s freshman guard — who finished with 18 points, 10 rebounds and eight assists to Mobley’s 17 points, five rebounds and three assists — had far more help thanks to a fearsome and cohesive Bulldogs roster that stands two wins from a perfect 32-0 season after an 85-66 victory.,But the comparisons among Mobley, Suggs and the other projected top-five picks in a , are just beginning in advance of the July 29 NBA draft. As the only big man among this year’s top-tier prospects, Mobley, 19, represents the latest test of the evolving value of a modern NBA big man. He arrives with a tantalizing skill set that could set him apart from other prospects whose high selections have resulted in second-guessing.,“He isn’t Anthony Davis, but he’s in that mold,” one Western Conference executive said. “That’s the mold I want.”,The NBA’s pace-and-space era has drastically altered the job description for elite centers: Rather than dominating with post-ups and hoarding rebounds, coveted big men can shoot from the outside, create for their teammates and handle a wide variety of defensive assignments, from stepping out against guards to protecting the basket area. The Denver Nuggets’ Nikola Jokic and the Philadelphia 76ers’ Joel Embiid have garnered MVP attention thanks in large part to their multilayered offensive games, while the Los Angeles Lakers’ Davis and the Miami Heat’s Bam Adebayo, two of the league’s most complete big men, met in the 2020 Finals.,Identifying these game-changing big men when they’re teenagers remains a maddening process. Davis and Embiid were both high lottery picks, but Adebayo dropped to 14th in 2017 and Jokic lasted until the second round in 2014. All four stars required major development during their professional careers, and other recent high lottery picks have yet to follow their lead down the star track.,Dragan Bender, the first big taken in 2016, didn’t pan out, and no big men were selected in the top nine picks of 2017. Deandre Ayton and Marvin Bagley III, the top two picks in 2018, have been overshadowed by Luka Doncic and Trae Young, perimeter playmakers who went later in the top five. Zion Williamson has transformed into an oversized initiator — “Point Zion” — rather than the small-ball center many envisioned when he was selected first in 2019. And there are growing whispers that LaMelo Ball, a lead ballhandler, should have been selected over lithe center James Wiseman, last year’s second pick.,But NBA front-office executives and scouts generally pushed back on the notion that Mobley, who was the Pac-12 player of the year and defensive player of the year, should be docked based solely on positional considerations. While Suggs and Oklahoma State guard Cade Cunningham project as possible franchise players who could make an immediate impact as rookies, several decision-makers argued that Mobley can develop into a prototypical modern big.,“I like Mobley much more than Ayton, Bagley and Wiseman” when they were coming out, an Eastern Conference executive said. “He [projects as] a much better defender. He’s better with the ball. Bagley and Wiseman were mistakes. You don’t want to make a mistake [by not taking Mobley] because you were trying to avoid someone else’s mistake.”,The seven evaluators, who were reached by telephone and text message before USC’s loss to Gonzaga and spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak freely, praised Mobley’s comfort playing on the perimeter on both offense and defense, his length, his shot-blocking skills and his ability to attack off the dribble and find the open man.,One Western Conference executive said Mobley must fill out physically like Davis has throughout his 20s, but he added in a text message that he considered Mobley a strong candidate to go first overall because “size still matters. SIZE WILL ALWAYS MATTER IN BASKETBALL.”,The relative value of sheer size has come under scrutiny in recent years as slow-footed traditional centers have found it harder to earn big contracts and playoff minutes. Jokic has played his best basketball after slimming down, while two-time all-star center Andre Drummond, a big-bodied volume rebounder, was recently bought out by the Cleveland Cavaliers after failing to generate interest before the trade deadline.,“There were playable centers available for cheap in free agency,” a Western Conference executive said. “There were plenty of centers on the buyout market. This is a guard’s game, and centers [who aren’t elite] are treated like running backs in the NFL. At some point, that carries over to how teams draft. If I have a top pick, the big has to do it all. [Only] finishing lobs isn’t enough. [Only] blocking shots isn’t enough. [Only] shooting threes isn’t enough. There is a hell of a high threshold on young big men right now.”,An Eastern Conference executive agreed: “Any player I pick high in the draft now, including bigs, must have a diverse skill set. Ballhandling. Shooting. All of it.”,Mobley isn’t a flawless prospect, although he averaged an impressive 16.4 points, 8.7 rebounds, 2.4 assists and 2.9 blocks per game. The Murrieta, Calif., native must improve as a three-point shooter and free throw shooter, and he is not a back-to-the-basket scoring force. Although Mobley appears to be a more creative and dynamic all-around offensive threat than Ayton, who has settled into a complementary role for the Phoenix Suns, he is not as silky or as advanced as Davis.,“[My checklist is] defense, efficient scoring and playmaking,” a Western Conference executive said. “A center who shoots a high percentage from the line, is efficient at the rim, can pass the ball and handle a little bit even if they haven’t gotten their shooting range is still super valuable. Especially if they can dominate defensively.”,Indeed, defensive mobility and impact are perhaps the greatest cause for excitement for Mobley, who trusts his feet and displays a strong commitment to contesting shots.,If Mobley does go with one of the top few selections, his new team probably will pass on Suggs as well as Jalen Green and Jonathan Kuminga, a pair of perimeter athletes who spent this season playing for the ,. Such a decision could easily set up another round of “Ayton vs. Doncic” or “Ball vs. Wiseman” debates.,Mobley has “zero bust potential,” one Western Conference scout said, dismissing such talk. “He can really defend the pick and roll, so he can play in fourth quarters. Bagley can’t. The jury is out on Wiseman. Mobley can switch and protect the rim. It’s hard to find both in the same player. There’s enough there on offense. You can’t be afraid to miss big.”",sports

He beat a segregationist restaurateur, Lester Maddox, who was infamous for refusing to serve Black would-be diners.,“I could promise all I wanted about Atlanta’s bright, booming economic future,” ,, “but none of it would come about if Atlanta failed to cope with the racial issue.” Keeping his pledge, Allen two years later became the only Southern mayor to testify in support of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, , guaranteed equal voting rights for people of color and lesser means.,Two years later, the the city , and Major League Baseball moved a club there from Milwaukee. In 1968, the NBA relocated the St. Louis Hawks to Georgia Tech’s downtown coliseum.,In more recent years, Atlanta got a WNBA team, an MLS club and two NHL franchises (though it lost both). It has hosted several Super Bowls, Final Fours and those Olympic Games centered on that park off Allen Jr. Boulevard. It would have been the site of the 2020 Final Four, ,.,In short, Atlanta became one of our country’s leading sports cities, largely thanks to Allen’s daringness to champion racial equality in the South, starting at the voting booth.,But this month, just over half a century later, reactionary Georgia politicians acted to shove their state and Atlanta back in time , that threaten the protections for Black Georgians that Allen advocated for — with his actions ultimately attracting our national sports industry, which is at least symbolically representative of the meritocracy in which most of us strive to live.,So until further notice, what sports brought to Atlanta, it should take away.,As , upon seeing Georgia State Rep. Park Cannon (D), a Black woman, , for knocking on the office door of Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) — mimicking the worst scenes of the old Jim Crow South — baseball should lead the way by moving its All-Star Game, ,, to another city. MLB players’ union head , was open to talking to Commissioner Rob Manfred about exactly that.,“Players are very much aware,” Clark told the Boston Globe. “As it relates to the All-Star Game, we have not had a conversation with the league on that issue. If there is an opportunity to, we would look forward to having that conversation.”,Los Angeles Dodgers Manager Dave Roberts, ,, also said last week , as a form of protest.,Moving the game wouldn’t be unprecedented. The NBA , in protest of North Carolina’s so-called bathroom bill, which discriminated against transgender people. The NFL , from Phoenix after Arizona voters rejected propositions that would have made Martin Luther King Jr. Day an official state holiday. And in 1965, the American Football League , after Black stars refused to play upon being shunned at hotels and restaurants in the city.,Baseball isn’t the only sport that can protest Georgia’s infringement on basic democratic rights with inhuman rules such as not allowing third-party groups to hand out bottles of water to voters standing in line. FIFA, soccer’s international governing body, should disqualify Atlanta as a candidate to be one of ,hosting the 2026 World Cup. It should nix the suggestion, too, that Atlanta’s broadcast infrastructure be the hub for the tournament’s media production., would be given “significant consideration” for the next Final Four up for bid after losing last year’s canceled event. The NCAA should scratch that thought now.,This could be yet another example of how sport can serve a greater good and live up to its vision of itself as an agent of social change. Atlanta saw it exercised recently when WNBA players , (D) to unseat then-Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R), who was co-owner of the Atlanta Dream , in particular and many women’s rights in general. The players not only succeeded in getting , but also ,.,That was using sports as an agent for social change. What Allen did was turn sports into a , for social change, a development he helped spearhead in Atlanta along with King and the city’s other legendary civil rights leaders. Sports even turned out to be a catalyst to recast the image of the state and its flagship city, propelling both into larger leadership roles in the South.,There was a time when Georgia and Atlanta were vying with Alabama and Birmingham to be the most influential region of the South. But a onetime baseball announcer in Alabama named Bull Connor, elected to Birmingham’s misnamed position of commissioner of public safety, became the face of the state’s brutal response to Black Alabamians advocating for civil rights. He enforced Birmingham’s ,, which made it illegal for Black and White people to participate together in any recreation, including checkers.,The law locked Birmingham out of the pro baseball exhibition circuit after Jackie Robinson was allowed to play in the major leagues. Connor even enforced it against an integrated all-star game organized by Robinson in 1953. The game was played only after Robinson sat the White players.,The racist intransigence of that generation of White Alabama leaders remains reflected in the state and Birmingham today. The South’s major airport developed in Atlanta. Birmingham never got an NFL, NBA or MLB team. The best it ever got was a football team in the short-lived USFL and Michael Jordan’s tenure with the city’s minor league baseball team.,That’s where Atlanta could be if not for Allen’s victory and leading role in ensuring voting rights for Georgians of color. And that’s what sports should remind those elected Georgians — the ones acting to take the state back to an ugly yesteryear — right now.",sports
https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2021/03/30/karl-anthony-towns-mom-dad/,Karl-Anthony Towns played before his father for the first time since his mother died of covid,"Karl-Anthony Towns of the Minnesota Timberwolves played Monday night with his father in attendance for the first time since his mother died of covid-19 nearly a year ago.,“Me and my dad got emotional before the game,” , against the Nets at Brooklyn’s Barclays Center, “because he made his presence known. It affected me because my mom always did that.”,Jacqueline Cruz-Towns, whom her son has called the “boss” of the family, often attended her son’s games, sitting near the court and enthusiastically cheering him on.,“My mom would be the one to go at the stanchion,” Towns said Monday, “or be there and wave at me until I said hi to her or came and hugged her.”,Towns revealed in March 2020 that his mother was , and in a medically induced coma after contracting the ,. In talking about the experience in ,, Towns pleaded with the public to take the pandemic seriously.,“The severity of this disease is real,” he warned in the video. “This disease needs to not be taken lightly. Please protect your family, your loved ones, your friends, yourself. Practice social distancing. Please don’t be in places with a lot of people. This disease is deadly.”,Jacqueline Cruz-Towns, 58,,. His father, Karl Towns Sr., also contracted the virus and was hospitalized. The Timberwolves star, who contracted the virus himself in January, said in December that the disease had killed seven of his family members.,After a Timberwolves win later that month, Towns described ,. “I don’t even recognize most of my other games and years I’ve played and how I felt those days,” he told reporters. “If I can be honest with y’all for a second, I mean, I don’t really recall or really care. I only know what happened from April 13 on. Because you may see me smiling and stuff, but that Karl died on April 13. He’s never coming back. I don’t remember that man. I don’t know that man. You’re talking to the physical me, but my soul has been killed off a long time ago.”,In April, a family spokesman described the family as “heartbroken” by her death. “Jackie was many things to many people — a wife, mother, daughter, grandmother, sister, aunt, and friend. … She was an incredible source of strength; a fiery, caring, and extremely loving person, who touched everyone she met. Her passion was palpable and her energy will never be replaced.”,Before Monday’s game, Towns spotted his father, who was wearing a jersey with the family name on this back, and trotted over to greet him. Towns, who grew up in New Jersey, went on to score 31 points with 12 rebounds and five assists in a 112-107 loss to the Nets. About a dozen family members attended the game, and afterward Towns hung around to play tag on the court with a niece and nephew.,“It was really the first time having family watch me playing in person” since the pandemic began, Towns said, “and it’s crazy seeing my dad. I’m like: ‘Where’s my mom? She’s going to come.’ And, obviously, she’s not going to show up. That affected me, but I go out there and play the best I can for this team.”,“He understood how upset I was after the loss,” Towns added, “but he came to me, and he told me something I don’t know if he should’ve told me. It got me a little emotional. He told me my mom would’ve been proud with how I played tonight.”",sports
https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2021/03/30/nfl-mock-draft-49ers-trade/,NFL mock draft: Where the first-round QBs will land after the 49ers traded up,"The , of the 2021 NFL draft raises some fascinating possibilities.,Most likely, the 49ers moved up to take a quarterback. That could lead to three quarterbacks being drafted in the first three picks, which has happened only twice in NFL history. If the Atlanta Falcons then take a quarterback with the fourth selection or another team trades up to do so, the NFL would have four quarterbacks go in the first four picks — which has never happened.,The timing of the trade was fitting, as it took place Friday when Zach Wilson was holding his pro day workout. The Brigham Young quarterback is increasingly being projected as the second pick by the New York Jets, which could mean the 49ers’ choice comes down to Alabama’s Mac Jones or North Dakota State’s Trey Lance.,Quarterbacks occupying the top few picks will have a trickle-down effect. Let’s take a look at how the first round could shake out with our latest mock draft:,New coach Urban Meyer acknowledged this week the likelihood that the Jaguars would make Lawrence the top pick, which has been what everyone has been assuming since Jacksonville locked up the No. 1 selection. Lawrence is one of the highest-rated quarterbacks to enter the pros in years.,Wilson’s strong workout Friday came pretty close to locking him in as the Jets’ selection at No. 2. Rumors started leaking out after the workout that Sam Darnold might be available in a trade. The Jets probably would need to be willing to accept less than a first-rounder for Darnold in a trade — the Carolina Panthers and Denver Broncos are two possibilities — given that the acquiring team might not pick up Darnold’s fifth-year option. Wilson would give them the chance to start over with a top talent at the position.,Late last season, 49ers Coach Kyle Shanahan said he liked the Kansas City Chiefs’ plan of developing a quarterback that they used in drafting Patrick Mahomes and having him sit behind starter Alex Smith for a year. If they were to replicate that model with Jimmy Garoppolo, whom they said after the trade is still their starter for this year, the most logical selection is Lance. He only played one game last year and faced a lower level of competition in college but has great physical tools and upside. Mac Jones is the most NFL-ready of this year’s quarterbacks after Lawrence and should be under consideration as well.,The Falcons could take quarterback Justin Fields, but they still appear to be leaning toward taking a position player to help build around Matt Ryan. Sewell, the best blocker in the draft, can come in as a rookie and start at guard, then move to tackle next year.,Sewell would make sense here if he falls to the Bengals, but if not, Pitts, who despite being a tight end could be the best pass-catcher in the draft, is a great option.,The Dolphins didn’t mind trading down from the third pick to the 12th because it got them first-rounders in 2022 and 2023, and then they promptly sent their 2022 first-rounder to the Eagles to move back up six spots in this year’s order. Presumably, that was to land one of the top pass-catchers in this year’s draft to help second-year quarterback Tua Tagovailoa. Chase is a dynamic, big target who would pair well opposite Will Fuller V, the speedster who signed in free agency.,There might only end up being two defensive players among the first 12 selections, and Parsons has the chance to be one of them. He has the range and speed to be a playmaker on defense. The Lions could consider Justin Fields here, but they seem intent on going with Jared Goff at quarterback this year.,Owner David Tepper is willing to give up just about anything to upgrade at quarterback. His preference is Deshaun Watson, but the Houston Texans say they aren’t trading him, and it remains to be seen ,. The Panthers are a candidate to trade up and draft a passer, but in this scenario Fields drops to them.,The Broncos could consider Mac Jones in this scenario if they can’t get a veteran quarterback before the draft. But they also have the luxury of taking the best player available after restocking their defense in free agency, and Slater qualifies.,With Caleb Farley having a back procedure, Surtain became the clear-cut top cornerback in the draft. And the Cowboys need to improve their pass coverage.,General Manager Dave Gettleman is looking for good players along his offensive and defensive lines, and Vera-Tucker would help make up for the loss of guard Kevin Zeitler, who was cut this offseason. He has been rising up draft boards after a good pro day workout.,The Eagles didn’t mind moving back in the first round, knowing they are rebuilding and could have as many as three first-round picks in next year’s draft. Horn is a physical cornerback who is great in man-to-man coverage. Philadelphia could also draft a wide receiver here to help second-year quarterback Jalen Hurts.,The Chargers needed to fix their offensive line in front of second-year quarterback Justin Herbert, and they did well in free agency by signing Corey Linsley at center and adding the second-best available guard in Matt Feiler. Darrisaw would complete the overhaul.,The Vikings have done well on defense by getting cornerback Patrick Peterson and tackle Dalvin Tomlinson in free agency, and the next move should be to address the pass rush. Paye is a great athlete and could develop opposite Danielle Hunter.,Jones could go as high as No. 3, and for the Patriots to land him they might need to trade up. They are in position to do so after Bill Belichick filled many roster holes in free agency. Jones would be a good fit to develop behind starter Cam Newton, given his experience in the pro-style offense Nick Saban runs at Alabama.,Even after signing Malcolm Butler last week, the Cardinals still need help at cornerback following Peterson’s departure. Farley is one of the best cornerbacks in the draft and a great value at this spot.,The Raiders will be looking for a defensive lineman or an offensive lineman, but there is no way they pass on a pass-catcher as good as Smith if he falls this far.,Miami traded Shaq Lawson, so edge rusher is a need. This would be a good spot for Oweh, who has great physical ability, to develop.,Washington has addressed its offense in free agency, signing quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick and wide receivers Curtis Samuel and Adam Humphries. It could bolster its line with Jenkins, who is an excellent run blocker.,The Bears had to cut cornerback Kyle Fuller to stay under the salary cap. Newsome gives them a cornerback they can plug and play right away.,The Colts are looking for a replacement for retired left tackle Anthony Castonzo. They signed Sam Tevi but gave him backup money on a one-year, $2.5 million deal. Cosmi is 6-7, 309 pounds and a very good pass-blocker.,The Titans lost Humphries and Corey Davis, so wide receiver is one of their biggest needs. Waddle has great speed and quickness and could be drafted much earlier than this, but the depth of the wideout class could lead to some teams waiting until Day 2 to draft one. Waddle is also a good returner.,The Jets have a desperate need at cornerback, and with good size at 6-2, Joseph fits the profile of what Coach Robert Saleh wants at the position.,The Steelers will be tempted to take a running back with their first-round pick, but they need a replacement for Bud Dupree and have a long history of taking edge rushers in the first round.,The Jaguars are switching to a 3-4 defense, so they need to beef up the interior of their defensive line. Barmore is disruptive and would be a good fit.,Collins is one of the best pure 4-3 linebackers available, so the Browns would get great value in drafting him here.,The Ravens lost two pass rushers in free agency when Yannick Ngakoue signed with Las Vegas and Matthew Judon went to New England. Owusu-Koramoah is known for his coverage more than his pass-rush ability, but he nonetheless fills a need at linebacker.,The Saints had to cut Emmanuel Sanders, so they need a wide receiver who is quick off the line of scrimmage and a good route-runner. Bateman fits the bill.,The Packers need to get some wideout help for Aaron Rodgers. Marshall has good size and big-play ability.,The Bills are always looking for pass-rush help. They’ll feel fortunate if Phillips falls to them toward the bottom of the first round.,The Chiefs are rebuilding their offensive line after injuries left them compromised during their Super Bowl loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. They started by signing guards Joe Thuney and Kyle Long, but they need to add one more lineman, likely a tackle, with this pick.,Moehrig is the best safety in the draft, so it’s hard to see him slipping into the second round.",sports
https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2021/03/30/usopc-olympic-trials-protests-rule-50/,"USOPC will allow social justice demonstrations at Olympic trials, pushing back against IOC rule","In an open letter to American athletes Tuesday, the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee provided guidance on permitted social and racial justice demonstrations, saying it would allow acts such as raised fists on the podium and kneeling during the national anthem. Such permission places the national committee at odds with the International Olympic Committee’s staunch rule against political protest.,The USOPC’s policy applies to Team USA trials this spring and summer but not to the Tokyo Olympics, which the IOC will oversee. The IOC steadfastly has resisted calls from athletes around the globe, ,, to overturn Rule 50, the rule in the Olympic charter that outlaws “demonstration or political, religious or racial propaganda.”,“While we support your right to demonstrate peacefully in support of racial and social justice, we can’t control the actions others may take in response,” USOPC CEO Sarah Hirshland wrote Tuesday.,Hammer thrower Gwen Berry, whom the USOPC placed on probation after she raised her fist on the podium in protest of racial inequality after winning gold at the 2019 Pan American Games, praised the letter as bold and well done. She believes support from the USOPC, despite the threat of punishment from the IOC, may give confidence to athletes who otherwise would have backed down from protesting at the Olympics.,“Real issues are highlighted when people have support,” Berry said. “When people don’t have support, they’ll just hide in the shadows and they won’t say anything. The fact that we do have support now, you never know how somebody will flourish and the issues some people will talk about.”,In the letter, Hirshland included guidance for the trials that “defines latitude for athletes to express their personal perspectives on racial and social justice in a respectful way, and without fear of sanction from the USOPC.”,The USOPC defined racial and social demonstration as “promoting the human dignity of individuals or groups that have historically been underrepresented, minoritized, or marginalized in their respective societal context.” Its specific examples of approved demonstration included wearing a hat with the phrase “Black Lives Matter” or “Trans Lives Matter,” vocally advocating for equal rights for minorities, holding up a fist, and kneeling during the national anthem.,The USOPC’s letter also outlined “impermissible elements” of demonstration that would result in discipline. They include wearing clothing with hate speech; hand gestures affiliated with hate groups; violence; defacing a national flag; and “protests aimed explicitly against a specific organization, person or group of people.”,“I feel like it was important that they did include things that they will not allow,” Berry said. “Things that are discriminatory. Things that will not enhance the growth of any type of social reform. I think that was really important to put in there. Some people might try to rebel. They might say, ‘Well since this issue can be highlighted or acknowledge, why can’t this?’ The details in what is allowed and not allowed, I feel like they did a very good with implementing that.”,While providing athletes support, the new guidelines create a maze of hypothetical quandaries for the USOPC. For example, if an athlete takes aim at the IOC for not pressuring China — the host country of the 2022 Winter Olympics — on human rights violations, would that be considered a protest explicitly against a specific organization?,The USOPC has struggled for years with how to approach athlete protest. Even as it came to celebrate the famed 1968 raised-fist protest of racial injustice by Tommie Smith and John Carlos, it took cues from the IOC and followed international guidelines that prohibited demonstrations. In 2019, the USOPC placed fencer Race Imboden and Berry on probation after Imboden knelt on the podium and Berry raised a fist during the national anthem at the Pan American Games in Peru.,Hirshland ,, when amid widespread civic protests of racial injustice athletes shared their experiences and concerns during a virtual town hall. The USOPC then formed “an athlete-led group to challenge the rules and systems in our own organization that create barriers to progress, including your right to protest.” Hirshland also apologized to athletes who “sacrificed your moment on the podium to call for change.”,In December, the Team USA Council on Racial and Social Justice, backed by the USOPC, joined the USOPC Athletes’ Advisory Council in calling on the IOC to change Rule 50.,The IOC Athletes’ Commission has been reviewing Rule 50 and could make a recommendation on keeping or changing the rule before the Tokyo Games, perhaps this month. IOC President Thomas Bach has supported Rule 50, writing in an October , in the Guardian that the Games should not “descend into a marketplace of demonstrations of all kinds, dividing and not uniting the world.”,The IOC did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday.,After a year of racial reckoning in the United States, the IOC is likely to be tested in Tokyo. Sprinter Noah Lyles, projected to be one of the Games’ biggest stars, , of a Diamond League track meet in Monaco last summer. He is one of several Americans who have said they would consider a protest in Tokyo. If they do, they’ll have the backing of their governing body.,“I feel like it’s a victory for all the Black athletes in America who do feel that America has more work to do as far as supporting people who look like us,” Berry said. “It’s a victory for everybody, honestly.”",sports

Teams will play one additional regular season game and one fewer preseason game beginning with the 2021 season.,It is the first modification to the length of the NFL season since the league went from a 14-game schedule to a 16-game regular season in 1978. The NFL also announced that it plans for four of the 16 additional games per season, beginning in 2022, to be ,.,NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell called the move “momentous” and said during a conference call with reporters, “This change clearly is going to provide fans with more meaningful and quality games that otherwise would not have been scheduled.”,Goodell also said the league plans to “have full stadiums in the upcoming season” after the NFL completed its 2020 season with games played in empty or partially filled stadiums amid the , pandemic.,“We’re also discussing our plans to welcome back all of our fans for the 2021 season across the country at all NFL stadiums,” Goodell said. “As you know, we had 1.2 million fans safely attend games last year. All of us in the NFL want to see every one of our fans back. Football is simply not the same without fans, and we expect to have full stadiums in the upcoming season.”,League officials reiterated Tuesday that, based on studies, no clusters of coronavirus cases have been traced to any of the 119 NFL games last season at which fans were in attendance.,Owners long had sought to lengthen the regular season as a revenue-boosting measure. They proposed an 18-game season, with a two-game preseason, during their labor negotiations with the NFL Players Association that led to the 2011 collective bargaining agreement. The union objected on player-safety grounds and called the proposal a non-starter, and owners abandoned the measure for that labor deal.,But they came back to it during the negotiations that led to last year’s new CBA. The owners’ focus shifted to 17 games when the union remained firmly against an 18-game season, and the , became the owners getting a 17-game season in exchange for the players getting 48 percent of the league’s revenue under the salary cap system, with a “kicker” mechanism to potentially take that to 48.5 percent or slightly above. The union’s safety concerns had been mollified by cutbacks to the amount of hitting that players endure during the offseason and on the practice field.,The CBA was , in March 2020, giving the owners the right to implement the 17-game season as soon as 2021. That was accompanied by an expansion of the playoff field from 12 to 14 teams, which went into effect this past season. The 17-game season was incorporated by the owners into their negotiation of the , worth more than $110 billion over 11 years through the 2033 season. Teams divide that revenue evenly, and players receive their share under the salary cap.,The completion of the broadcasting deals was viewed as the final step toward enacting the 17-game season, and the outcome of the owners’ vote Tuesday was considered a foregone conclusion.,Owners , in December. The additional home game will rotate annually by conference. AFC teams will have nine home games each in the 2021 regular season, while NFC teams have eight apiece. That will be reversed in 2022.,The extra game will be an out-of-conference game based on the divisional order of finish from the previous season. For the 2021 season, AFC East teams play NFC East teams; AFC North teams face NFC West teams; AFC South teams oppose NFC South teams; and AFC West teams play NFC North teams. So, for example, the Kansas City Chiefs, the first-place team in the AFC West last season, will host the Green Bay Packers, the first-place team in the NFC North.,The NFL also announced that the 2021 regular season will begin Sept. 9 and conclude Jan. 9. The schedule for the 2021 season is expected to be released in May.,The three-game preseason is expected to result in teams having a bye during what, until now, has been Week 4 of the preseason schedule. Each team will still have one bye week during the regular season, which now becomes 18 weeks long.,That pushes back the postseason by one week. The Super Bowl for the 2021 season will be played Feb. 13, 2022, in Los Angeles, one week before Presidents’ Day weekend. Had the 2020 season been one week longer, this year’s Super Bowl would have been played on the Sunday immediately before Presidents’ Day, giving the nation a holiday on the day after the year’s most-watched TV event.,Under the NFL’s international plan, four of the additional 16 games in a 17-game season will be chosen as neutral-site games each year and played internationally. Each team will play an international game at least once every eight years, giving the league scheduling certainty as it attempts to increase its popularity worldwide.,Some players have continued to express their opposition to a 17-game season, even after their ratification of the CBA last year by a 60-vote margin. New Orleans Saints running back Alvin Kamara , over the weekend that a 17-game season is “dumb … as hell.”,The NFL informed teams Tuesday that they can begin their offseason programs for players April 19, according to a person familiar with the matter. There has been no agreement yet between the league and the NFLPA about offseason rules and to what extent teams might have on-field practices, if at all.",sports
https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2021/03/20/paige-bueckers-uconn/,How Connecticut freshman Paige Bueckers is breaking college basketball,"There are precious few secrets anymore when it comes to Paige Bueckers, who was a Minnesota hoops phenom as a seventh-grader; who 13 months ago became the first high school girl to grace the cover of Slam magazine; who on any given day might dish out fashion tips or social-justice truth to her 671,000 Instagram followers; and who, as the final seconds of overtime ticked down on the evening of Feb. 8 in Storrs, Conn., might as well have worn a sign saying, “I WILL BE TAKING THIS LAST SHOT.”,The clock dwindling, the Connecticut freshman broke open. A defender draped on her, she gathered the ball near the top of the key. A hand in her face, she let it fly.,Bueckers’s dagger bounced impossibly high off the back rim before falling in — her 11th, 12th and 13th consecutive points for the Huskies down the stretch, and her 29th, 30th and 31st for the game as U-Conn., ranked No. 2 nationally at the time, took down top-ranked South Carolina.,“There’s guys who lug the piano up onstage, and there’s guys who play the piano. And there’s a reason why the guy who plays the piano makes all the money — because that’s what people come to watch,” Connecticut Coach Geno Auriemma said afterward. “Paige is a good piano player.”,As the top-seeded Huskies (24-1) prepare to open a most unusual NCAA women’s tournament Sunday night against No. 16 seed High Point — in a ,quarantine “bubble” in San Antonio, and without Auriemma, who tested positive for the , this past week — it is worth revisiting their hard-earned win against South Carolina, both for what it said about Bueckers, who, at 19, might already be the best player in the country, and about U-Conn.,First, about U-Conn.: No other program could call a four-year period featuring three Final Four appearances (and one tournament canceled by a global pandemic) a drought. But in Storrs, where success is measured solely by national titles, the term fits. Last spring, the Huskies, for the first time since 2008, graduated a senior class that failed to win an NCAA title.,All 10 of their championships this century have been won behind generational talents — Sue Bird, Diana Taurasi, Maya Moore and Breanna Stewart — who have 13 WNBA championships and 23 first-team all-WNBA nods. But none of them were asked to step in as freshmen and do what Bueckers has this season, for a Huskies team that has five other freshmen and no seniors.,She is averaging 35.7 minutes, nearly 14 more than Stewart did as a freshman, while scoring more points (19.7) than Moore (17.8) did and dishing out nearly twice as many assists (6.1) as Taurasi turned in (3.3).,“It’s been a long time since one player has had to carry the team as much as she’s had to in some of these games,” Auriemma said.,The South Carolina win was the most vivid example, proving that, when tested, U-Conn. will put the ball in Bueckers’s hands and ask her to win the game. Such tests are few and far between; U-Conn.’s 10 wins since Feb. 8, including three in the Big East tournament, have come by an average margin of 33 points. But she’s there if the Huskies need it.,“Coach put in my head as a [high school] senior how he was going to want me to step in and be a leader right away,” Bueckers said in a telephone interview. “That was kind of different — actually learning and going through the process of being a good leader for the team right away.”,Bueckers played all 45 minutes against South Carolina, scored the game’s final four points of regulation and all nine for the Huskies in overtime, single-handedly outscoring the nation’s No. 1 team 13-5 in that span. It was her third straight 30-point game, something no other player in U-Conn. history had done. Those last three points came with everyone in the arena knowing she would be taking that shot.,“How does the legend grow from here?” Monica McNutt, the color commentator on Fox Sports 1 that night, blurted as the shot fell through. That was followed by: “Wh-what?” And moments later, with an uneasy chuckle: “This is scary. This is very scary.”,A month later, McNutt, a former standout guard at Georgetown, still had trouble processing what she had seen.,“I will admit I was a little skeptical,” McNutt said in a telephone interview. “But, boy, did she shut me up. She’s as good as anyone I’ve seen at that age.”,Bueckers already has joined Moore as the only freshmen to be named the Big East freshman of the year and player of the year in the same season. She has a chance to become the only freshman in history to be named national player of the year. By at least one objective measure, the honor would be warranted: Her 11.0 win shares, per ,, lead the nation.,If there is a secret remaining with Bueckers — her fame underscored by an Instagram account that has more followers at the moment than those of Bird, Rudy Gobert and Katie Ledecky, among others — it lies in the question of how:,How does she coax so much production out of a 5-foot-11 frame so unsubstantial that her high school coach nicknamed her “Olive Oyl” after the gangly Popeye character?,How, at 19, can she carry a team that plays its home games beneath 11 national championship banners?,Put more simply: How is she so good?,The answer can be arrived at in a few ways.,Obviously, she is athletically gifted, with impressive speed, enough hops to grab the rim and remarkable hand-eye coordination. Though she stopped playing baseball after fourth grade, her father, Bob, said she made the league all-star team: “When she threw the ball, it was on a rope and hit you in the glove.”,She is also a self-described gym rat who has yet to come across someone who can outwork her.,“She lived two blocks from a gym, Lifetime Fitness, and when I’d call to pick her up for practice, she’d say, ‘Pick me up at Lifetime,’ ” recalled her AAU coach, Tara Starks. “And then, when practice was over, she’d want me to drop her off back at the gym.”,An incurable hoops junkie, she will watch NBA games if there are no college games on TV, and G League games if there are no NBA games. Asked if she ever detaches from basketball, she reacted with horror: “No. I can’t detach from family, and I can’t detach from basketball.”,And she is well-rounded: Though she considers herself a pass-first point guard (she’s tied for ninth in the country in assists per game), she is also shooting 53.9 percent from the field (tops among guards) and 47.4 percent from three-point range (third in the nation). McNutt compares her size and skills to Taurasi, arguably the best playmaker in WNBA history, and her handle to Stephen Curry and Kyrie Irving. “She’s in an elite class of playmakers,” McNutt said.,But the true source of Bueckers’s greatness might be her court vision. Perhaps better than anyone in recent memory, she reads the constantly shifting geometry of basketball — the formations, the defensive shifts, the openings, the passing lanes — and reacts to it soonest and fastest, but never too soon or too fast, with precisely the correct pass, move or shot.,“She’s just built with unbelievable vision, to where she sees the floor two or three passes in advance,” said Brian Cosgriff, who, as Bueckers’s coach at Hopkins High in Minnetonka, Minn., bestowed the “Olive Oyl” nickname upon her. “When she’s bringing the ball down the floor, she’s seeing and reading where everyone else is on the floor, and she’s going to make the right read 99 percent of the time. You’re just born with that. You can’t teach it. You can’t practice it.”,Bueckers agreed that it is a skill she was born with.,“The biggest thing I take pride in is making my teammates around me better,” she said, “and, yeah, court vision has a lot to do with it: Just seeing things before they play out and being two or three steps ahead.”,Cosgriff compares that aspect of Bueckers’s game to Magic Johnson. Others have invoked names such as Pete Maravich, Larry Bird, Draymond Green or even NFL legend Jim Brown — the latter comparison coming from the 66-year-old Auriemma.,“She takes her time,” Auriemma said. “. . . She’s like when Jim Brown used to run. When she gets the ball, she kind of [says]: ‘Should I [take] that hole, that one, that one? What’s the best decision for me right now?’ She waits until the absolute last minute, and nothing rushes her.”,Bueckers also has an intense competitiveness that can border on nasty. She has been known, on occasions when an opponent has gotten mouthy, to tell said opponent what is coming next — “I’m going to come off a screen to your right and hit a three in your face” — and then do it.,Lately, she has been hassling Auriemma about her playing time, complaining whenever he dares to take her out of a game. Late in one recent game, with the Huskies enjoying a comfortable lead and a teammate at the free throw line, she looked over at the scorer’s table, spotted a sub preparing to enter for her, and told the teammate to miss the free throw, so she might stay in.,“Then she came off and checked the stat sheet,” Auriemma recalled with feigned indignity, “and she goes, ‘You owe me two more minutes tomorrow, because I didn’t get to play my average [minutes].’ … I love her and everything, but there’s something not quite right about her.”,Auriemma, her teammates, anybody with the good sense to tune in and watch: We are all, in a way, Monica McNutt near the end of that South Carolina game, struggling to process what we are witnessing and asking ourselves a question,that might be partially answered over the next few weeks:,How does the legend grow from here?",sports
https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2021/03/19/dawn-staley-south-carolina-basketball-protest/,"Dawn Staley, another title in sight, won’t stop speaking out: ‘I can’t not do it’ ","At practice one afternoon in December, the South Carolina women’s basketball players spread out on a carpeted space away from the court. The university president wanted to talk to them.,Before games this season, most of the players, wanting to bring attention to systemic racism, had been sitting during the national anthem. Even with few fans in the arena, the act hadn’t gone unnoticed: ,, threats of boycott on Twitter and a Facebook rant describing the players as “unappreciative b----es” and suggesting their head coach be imprisoned as an American traitor.,But in Columbia, S.C., the team’s coach, Dawn Staley, will sooner get a court named after her than face serious blowback. Since her arrival in 2008, she has built a women’s basketball dynasty on Southern football turf, making nine straight , appearances, capturing six conference tournament championships and winning the national title in 2017. On Sunday, her team opens the tournament,as a No. 1 seed for the fifth time in the past eight years.,After winning that 2017 title, the state’s second-largest newspaper named Staley ,, ahead of Clemson football coach Dabo Swinney. The Republican governor once demanded an apology from a , who criticized Staley after a rowdy game at Columbia’s Colonial Life Arena. A South Carolina lawmaker recently introduced a , after her.,So when her players filled the socially distant chairs that afternoon, they could safely assume their coach would have their backs.,Still, this was South Carolina, where sitting for the anthem, as one Gamecocks alum told Staley in an email, is viewed by many as “despicable.”,The university president, Robert Caslen, is a retired Army lieutenant general. He told the players how he had sworn to defend the Constitution and supported their right for free speech, according to interviews with Caslen, Staley and players. He also mentioned how soldiers had died in his arms. He didn’t tell them what to do, but his background made it clear what ,does. He stands for the anthem.,Then, Staley, sitting beside her team, found herself doing what she had done all season. She began to speak up.,She had come home with scratched legs after battling all day with the boys. Staley, the smallest thing around the Raymond Rosen housing project in north Philadelphia, kept her mother worried but held her own on the basketball court. Near 23rd and Diamond streets, the intersection where she used to shoot jumpers at a crate fastened to a light pole, the sign now reads “Dawn Staley Lane.”,Staley brought her north Philly toughness and natural leadership to the University of Virginia. In the final seconds of overtime in the 1990 NCAA East Region final, Coach Debbie Ryan called a play, but Staley raised another idea. Virginia ran Staley’s play, and she drilled the midrange jumper, clinching the team’s first trip to the Final Four.,The next year, a teenage girl stood on the top ledge of a ,. The only person who could talk her down was her hero, Staley.,Staley started her coaching career in her hometown, at Temple University, but she moved in 2008 to South Carolina, where her mom was born and raised. Estelle Staley was a nice, churchgoing lady, Staley says, but one whose eyes you wouldn’t want to meet if you stole her parking spot at the mall.,“Oh, she ain’t letting them get away with it,” Staley says, laughing at the memory. “No, no, no! That window’s coming down.”,Staley is her mother’s daughter in that way. In her early days in Columbia, she went to the same local pizza place almost every day, tweeting love letters to her favorite pies. One day she and her family sat at an outdoor table. No one came to serve them, and the family felt mistreated. Miss Estelle wasn’t having it. They left.,Though her mother died in 2017, Staley hasn’t returned since. In the Book of Staley, right is right, and wrong is wrong.,“I grew up in a house like that,” she says. “There’s really no gray area.”,In Columbia, Staley inherited a program that hadn’t made the NCAA tournament in five years,and,averaged only 1,802 fans per game the season before she arrived. After her first home loss, as fans headed for the exits inside the nearly-empty gym, Staley searched for a microphone.,She urged everyone to stop walking. She thanked them for their loyalty and made them a promise: ,Twelve years later, they see her around campus, with a green tea-lemonade in hand, that Starbucks plastic stopper hanging from her mouth. Staley, 50, attends everything from softball games to welcome events for first-year Gamecocks. Students admire her. The bravest approach in awe and introduce themselves.,“Like she was Beyoncé,” says A’ja Wilson, the most decorated athlete in school history, who now plays for the WNBA’s Las Vegas Aces.,Beyond campus, Staley has built a fiercely devoted following. In the six seasons before the pandemic, the Gamecocks led NCAA women’s basketball in attendance, averaging 12,185 fans during the 2019-20 season. Beyoncé has her Beyhive; Staley calls their superfans the “G-Hive.” After the title in 2017, fans got into a bidding war for the right to have the special edition, state-issued Gamecocks license plate, “WB 33” (the team went 33-4 that season). The queen of this hive rolls around in a matte black Mercedes-Benz SUV nicknamed “Michelle” after the former first lady, and her license plate reads, “WB 1.”,“When she came to the program, you could pick wherever you wanted to sit in the arena,” says Judi Gatson, a veteran newscaster in Columbia and avowed G-Hive member. “[Now] tickets to her program are the hottest ticket in the state.”,She has accomplished this with unapologetic Blackness at a school, in a state, that in many ways clings to its Whiteness. The Gamecocks won their 2017 title with an all-Black roster; only two years before, the Confederate battle flag still flew on the grounds of the South Carolina State House a few blocks away. The university erected a golden statue of Wilson outside the arena. But on this same campus, ,, a segregationist politician, remains.,Last summer, when a group of current and former athletes called a news conference in front of the fitness center, demanding a name change, Staley showed up to speak.,“, the head ball coach in South Carolina,” says Kayin Jones, executive director of Black Lives Matter South Carolina. “Being an African-American woman and really excelling in her craft … taking them to national prominence, she’s done a hell of a job. And in doing so, it has allowed her voice to be that much louder. Her bullhorn, she can turn the volume up on it.”,In May, Staley couldn’t keep up with her thumbs. Days after watching , die under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer, her fingers pecked out her raw response, typos and all.,The tweet started Staley toward becoming one of the state’s most outspoken advocates for racial justice. She wrote an essay in the voice of a, woman. She hopped on Zoom calls with local reporters, knowing she was the only prominent Black coach at South Carolina to speak about Jacob Blake, the Black man shot seven times in the back by a police officer in Kenosha, Wis.,“Activism has always been here,” U.S. Rep. James E. Clyburn (D-S.C.) says of Columbia, the state capital. “It just hasn’t been very well known.” Staley, he says, is “reflective of that kind of attitude that’s been in Columbia for a long, long time.”,Her Twitter account was her biggest pulpit, and she has made a habit of going back at people, even if they identify themselves as Gamecocks fans. When a disgruntled fan claimed to be done with Staley after her support of Blake, she vowed to be herself: “,” It’s a strange sight, an SEC coach urging someone to get off her timeline, but ,. She delights in leaving trolls “at the altar,” as she calls it.,“I say what’s on my mind,” Staley says. “I can’t not do it. I can’t not post it because I don’t want to live with thinking that I should’ve said something and I didn’t.”,Staley knows she has upset some fans with her tweets and her takes on race in America. She knew there would be backlash, especially when all nine Black women on the team decided before the season to stage a silent protest.,The Gamecocks coaches, including Staley, and one White player typically stand for the anthem. The other White player, sophomore Olivia Thompson, started the season sitting with her teammates. Then, before the Dec. 3 game against North Carolina State, Thompson told Staley that sitting didn’t send a strong enough message for her. She wanted to take a knee.,“ ‘They’re going to tear her ass up.’ That’s what I said to myself,” Staley recalls. So before the anthem played, Staley walked over to Thompson, placed her right hand over her player’s shoulder and ,“A big thing with her is how she stands up for the people she cares about and the things she cares about,” Thompson says. “I feel like there’s nothing she wouldn’t do for us as players.”,Soon after that game, Caslen met with the team. He’s a fan of Staley — “She’s a national icon, and everybody loves her. When I get around her, I get a little nervous,” Caslen says — but he wanted to talk with her players about sitting for the anthem.,He maintained that their method wasn’t working with the people who needed to hear their message. Staley encouraged them to listen, but she also encouraged them to speak their minds, and they did.,After Caslen left, Staley addressed her team. She told them she wanted them to know the other side of the argument — to try to understand where people who shared Caslen’s views were coming from. She told them to take it all in.,But, like Caslen, she never told the players who had chosen to sit what to do. Before the next game, and every game since, they sat.",sports

Cash will no longer be accepted, several popular concession stands and gathering places will be closed until further notice, and eating and drinking on the concourse will be prohibited.,An annual tour for media members at Nationals Park on Tuesday was different, too, with most of the focus on the health and safety protocols for 2021.,For April games, the Nationals gave season plan holders, with priority based on plan size and tenure, the opportunity to purchase tickets in pods of one to six seats. All pods will be at least six feet apart, with a maximum of three pods per row, and unavailable seats will be closed with zip ties. Suites will be opened at reduced capacities.,All fans 2 years and older are required to wear a face covering at all times inside the ballpark, except when eating and drinking in their pod. Approved face coverings include KN95, N95, cloth and surgical masks. Bandannas, gaiters and face coverings with exhalation valves are not permitted. Disposable face coverings will be available at Nationals Park gates for any fans who arrive without one. Fans who do not comply with the face covering policy will receive a verbal warning followed by potential removal from the ballpark.,All tickets will be digital and color-coded, corresponding to a designated gate to be used for entering and exiting the ballpark. All gates will open two hours before first pitch, and all parking garages will open 2½ hours before first pitch.,The Nationals, ,, have again updated their bag policy. Under the stricter rules, only clutch bags measuring seven inches long by five inches tall by three-fourths of an inch wide or smaller, diaper bags and bags used for medical reasons are permitted. Lockers will be available outside the home plate and right field gates to store bags for a fee. Fans are still permitted to bring outside food into the ballpark, but they’ll have to carry it in their hands. Scott Fear, the Nationals vice president of public safety and security, said the new policy was enacted to limit congestion at gates and will be revisited after the season.,Hand sanitizer dispensers and signs and decals about social distancing have been installed throughout the ballpark. All toilets and urinals have been converted to touchless flushing systems, and MERV 13 air filters have been installed in indoor spaces, including the redesigned Champions Club on the club level, where , sits in a glass display case in front of a mural celebrating that team.,In another effort to limit contact between guests and ballpark workers, cash will not be accepted at any parking, ticketing, retail or concession locations inside Nationals Park, except to purchase tickets for the 50/50 raffle. Fans who only have cash for other items may exchange it for eCash that may be used throughout the ballpark at the advance ticket sales booth, the Budweiser Terrace or at guest services by Section 131.,Fans are encouraged to download and use the MLB , to order concessions from their seats and pay for food and beverages at portable concession stands. Fans who place a mobile order on the app can opt in to receive a message when their order is ready and then retrieve their items using a dedicated pickup line. Standard lines will also be available for fans who choose not to mobile order, with payment options including Apple Pay, credit cards and debit cards. All food will be served in covered packaging, and touchless condiment dispensers have been installed throughout the ballpark.,The kids play area by the right field gate and the Budweiser Brewhouse will not be open in 2021. The Ultra Loft, formerly called the Bud Light Loft, and the Swing Big Beer Pen will be closed at the start of the season, but the Nationals plan to assign seats to those areas if and when the D.C. government allows more than 5,000 fans per game. The team said it is in conversations with the city to increase capacity, possibly as soon as the Nationals’ second homestand later in April.,The Budweiser Terrace bar beyond the center field scoreboard will be open, but all furniture has been removed to discourage fans from gathering around it before and during the game. The only place that fans are permitted to remove their mask to eat or drink is in their seating pod.,While some concession stands, including Medium Rare, See You Tater and Haute Dogs will not be open this season, the Nationals are introducing some new food options for 2021. Arepa Zone will be featured at the Avoiding Gluten stand in Center Field Plaza. Fuku, ,, will replace , by Section 238.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2021/03/31/washington-nationals-bold-predictions/,"Five preposterously positive Nats predictions, including a Juan Soto Triple Crown","After they finished below .500 for the first time since 2011 during last year’s shortened season, , as the Nationals open their 2021 season on Thursday against the New York Mets in D.C. Ahead of Opening Day, here are five preposterously positive Nationals predictions that probably won’t (but maybe will!) happen this year.,For starters, leading the league in batting average, home runs and RBI is one of the ,. Miguel Cabrera’s , for the Detroit Tigers in 2012 was MLB’s first Triple Crown campaign in 45 years. The last National Leaguer to do it was Joe Medwick of the St. Louis Cardinals … in 1937. If Soto bats , during spring training, his RBI opportunities could be limited.,Soto captured what’s referred to as the , during last year’s shortened season, leading the NL in batting average (.350), on-base percentage (.490) and slugging percentage (.695). Through three seasons, the 22-year-old’s numbers ,, who won the Triple Crown in 1942 and 1947. Who’s to say that Soto, who is projected to hit roughly 40 home runs this season, won’t continue to get better? “You never know,” , when asked in December about the possibility of adding a Triple Crown to his already impressive résumé. “Maybe. I hope so. I’m going to keep grinding, man. You never know.”,Robles registered a paltry four stolen bases in five attempts as part of his dreadful 2020 campaign, during which he hit .220 with a career-worst 28 percent strikeout rate. Robles had 28 steals in 37 attempts in 155 games the year before, a less-than-ideal success rate for anyone with hopes of reaching 40 steals.,Robles, who will turn 24 in May, shed some weight during the offseason and simplified his approach at the plate this spring. The early returns ,. If Robles can stay healthy and get on base at a better clip than the .293 on-base percentage he posted last season, he has the speed atop the order to join Trea Turner and Alfonso Soriano as the only Nationals players to eclipse 40 stolen bases in a season. (Nyjer Morgan finished with 42 steals in 2009, but 18 of those came before Washington acquired him in a trade with the Pittsburgh Pirates.),The only time a pair of Nationals players combined to hit at least 70 home runs was in 2009, when Adam Dunn (38) and Ryan Zimmerman (33) did it for a 103-loss team. Bell and Schwarber, two of Washington’s biggest offseason acquisitions, are coming off down years. Bell hit .226/.305/.364 with eight home runs in 57 games for the Pirates, while Schwarber hit a career-low .188/.308/.393 with 11 home runs in 59 games for the Chicago Cubs. Bell has hit only 18 home runs since the all-star break in 2019. Schwarber has never hit lefties well (.197/.301/.348).,They weren’t teammates at the time, but Bell and Schwarber hit 37 and 38 home runs, respectively, in 2019. The shortened 2020 season was so unusual that it’s not unreasonable to chalk up their performances to the small sample size and expect both 28-year-olds to bounce back in a big way. Most projection systems peg Bell and Schwarber to combine for roughly 60 dingers, so an additional 10 isn’t all that far-fetched. Both players have been locked in this spring.,The Nationals play in what figures to be ,, and most projection systems, including the one at FanGraphs, have them as the , in the NL East behind the Braves and Mets. On top of the question marks in the lineup and starting rotation, Washington’s defense will take a hit with Bell and Schwarber in the field. The Nationals have never won more than 98 games in a season.,Can Stephen Strasburg return to form after carpal tunnel surgery and stay healthy throughout the season? Will Max Scherzer, who will turn 37 in July, continue to defy age and revert to his pre-pandemic greatness? After posting a 4.66 ERA last year, can Patrick Corbin pitch more like the World Series hero who managed a 3.25 ERA in 2019? If the answer to all three of those questions is yes, Washington could run away with the division title. Jon Lester and Joe Ross make for a solid back end of the rotation, and the bullpen could be a strength of this team for a change. Speaking of …,The defending World Series champion Los Angeles Dodgers return almost everyone from a bullpen that , in 2020. Washington’s 4.68 bullpen ERA was fourth worst in the National League last year. Will Harris is dealing with , that was originally believed to be a blood clot and will open the season on the injured list, free agent acquisition Brad Hand’s ,isn’t what it once was, and Tanner Rainey continues to work his way back from a muscle strain that cost him the first month of spring training.,Hand, who , with Washington, has a 2.70 ERA in 320 innings with San Diego and Cleveland since becoming a full-time reliever in 2016. Last year, he led the American League in saves (16) despite an average fastball velocity of 91.4 mph, which was down from his peak of 94 mph in 2018. Hand, who posted a career-best 7.25-to-1 strikeout-to-walk ratio last year, is expected to handle the closer role. Rainey allowed eight hits and struck out 32 in 20⅓ innings last season, and Wander Suero has looked dominant this spring.

UCLA’s men capped the night with a close win over No. 1 seed Michigan that made the Bruins just the second team to advance from the First Four to the Final Four — and the fifth No. 11 seed to do so — and Stanford’s top-seeded women staged a remarkable turnaround from a 12-point halftime deficit to upend second-seeded Louisville, which was outscored 30-13 in the fourth quarter of what turned into a 15-point win for the Cardinal.,Before that, the top-seeded South Carolina women routed No. 6 Texas, and the 30-0 Gonzaga men showed why they were their tournament’s top overall seed in swatting aside No. 6 USC.

Could that be ,, next up in the unbeaten mission of Gonzaga?,Really? That’s UCLA, that all-time kingpin in men’s college basketball, upstarting its way to becoming the fifth No. 11 seed in a Final Four, and just the second First Four participant in a Final Four, necessitating five tournament wins rather than four? That’s UCLA, with its smattering of fans staying 40 minutes after the game to stand and cheer second-year coach Mick Cronin, and marvel like they got the kind of unexpected glee to which they’re unaccustomed?,Apparently, it’s accurate.,“Unreal, man, unreal,” said UCLA’s Johnny Juzang, the Angeleno who transferred back from Kentucky and scored 28 of the ,’ hard 51 points on 11-for-19 shooting. “I love every single one of these guys. It’s incredible, man. Surreal. Surreal.”,As one might say in cases of surrealism, ,? Of all the idiosyncratic, potholed paths a team could take to a Final Four, get a load of this one: Squeeze into the men’s tournament off what you might call a run of non-momentum, with the matchless encouragement of four consecutive losses. Play the first night in the off-Broadway First Four, off Broadway here up at West Lafayette. Begin by falling into a 40-26 inconvenience.,Trail by five with 75 seconds left. Trail by three with 37 seconds left, miss a free throw and get the offensive rebound. Tough it out in overtime. Proceed. Win two more, over a good BYU and a heady Abilene Christian. Come to another ditch, a last-ditch three-point shot by Alabama that looked like it might have blown the game for UCLA. Tough out that, too, in overtime.,Play Michigan in a inelegant but palpitating final. Take the beauty Michigan showed in its , and sap that beauty right out of the No. 1 seed. Force 14 turnovers to enable Cronin to say, “That’s huge, huge, guys. In a low-possession game, to create 14 turnovers, is really why we won.”,Then, use your evident and considerable gut to eke out of a game where the two teams miss 64 of 105 shots. Win despite getting outrebounded 38-28, getting outscored in the paint 32-16, seeing 7-foot Hunter Dickinson occasionally go dominant in the second half toward his 11 points. Hold Franz Wagner, the sophomore Michigan phenom, to 1-for-10 shooting, including two late three-point tries that never seemed to have much chance as they traveled.,And then, when your 34-25 lead has dissipated and the game has reached 46-46 with 5:22 to go on a loud three-point swish by Chaundee Brown, do something really impressive. Hold Michigan without a field goal from there.,That’s one curious trail to the Final Four, and now UCLA has taken it after finishing fourth in the Pac-12 and glum in the first half of March. “You’ve got to be able to win different ways,” said Cronin, 49, who used to assist Rick Pitino at Louisville and then head-coach Murray State and Cincinnati. So they had won all kinds of different ways just in this tournament, and they had ended the exhilarating run of Michigan and second-year coach Juwan Howard, who felt his first mad pain in his first turn at Madness.,“It’s going to be tough to sleep tonight, but I’ll get through it,” said Howard, whose team saw two decent looks in the last 3.8 seconds, including Mike Smith’s three-point try off a fine, full-court, inbounds play.,His team (23-5) had inched ahead in the game of inches, 47-46 with 4:30 left, when Dickinson made one free throw out of two. (His team had missed five of 11 free throws.) Then, across the balance, UCLA (22-9) had wrung a few baskets out of the great muck. With 4:04 left Jules Bernard, who had been fighting an injury lately, zipped across the lane from the left to set up a turnaround for a 48-47 lead. With 1:05 left, Juzang made a fine little challenged jumper from the baseline for a 50-47 lead.,That was it. That was all the Bruins needed in what Cronin called “a Big Ten battle-royale game,” in which, “Nobody could find an offensive rhythm and that was just a credit to the defenses,” in which it proved “hard to get bodies off of bodies.”,From that mire, from all the mire of the last two-plus weeks, here came UCLA, up the ladders to cut the nets, at a giddy vista along its wacky obstacle course. Wait, was that UCLA, in a 19th Final Four for the all-time royal program, yet so unlikely one might have to rub one’s eyes and check again? Apparently it was.",sports

There, the Trojans desperately needed star freshman Evan Mobley to thrive. That was their path to the Final Four, an elite defensive performance that shuttered Gonzaga’s close-range efforts, and they had a soon-to-be NBA draft lottery pick manning that area.,Mobley shined throughout this season and in the NCAA men’s tournament, but in an Elite Eight matchup against the top-seeded Bulldogs, Gonzaga’s mustached sophomore with a headband, Drew Timme, quickly claimed that region as his territory. Southern California’s defense, with all its height and length, could do little to contain the prolific Gonzaga attack, and the Trojans crumbled on their way to an , Tuesday in the West Region final at Lucas Oil Stadium.,With Timme in the paint and freshman standout Jalen Suggs just about everywhere else, the Bulldogs continued their dominant run. On this night, they made it seem effortless, as though the sixth-seeded Trojans were just another opponent to breeze past. The Bulldogs (30-0) were never threatened as they powered their way to the Final Four. The program’s first national title stands just two wins away, with a semifinal scheduled for Saturday against No. 11 seed UCLA, which stunned top-seeded Michigan in the night’s final game. And so far this season, losing is a foreign concept to the Bulldogs.,“This is a heck of an accomplishment,” Coach Mark Few said. “We’re going to take it and savor it for what it is. That doesn’t lessen our desire to win this game, the next game or win two more games. We’re wise enough to know these are really, really special times.”,Gonzaga’s offense, facilitated skillfully by Suggs, proved again to be smooth and lethal. The Bulldogs didn’t commit their first turnover until only about a minute remained in the first half. By then, they had already made 19 baskets on 12 assists, good for 45 points and a monstrous lead. All evening, Southern California’s defense did little to disrupt Gonzaga’s flow.,Timme’s dominant presence down low led him to a team-high 23 points on 10-for-19 shooting. Corey Kispert and Suggs, with 18 points apiece, joined him in double figures. Kispert, a senior all-American, made three shots from deep and had a handful of other good looks that didn’t fall. Suggs, the star point guard, added eight assists and 10 rebounds, nearly recording a triple-double. Even with a second-half shooting performance that didn’t match the brilliance of the first, the Bulldogs delivered another complete outing.,“We were working together all night, not letting the ball get too sticky,” Suggs said. “We really did a good job, especially in the first half, in breaking that zone [defense] down.”,The Bulldogs finished with 46 points in the paint, fueled by Timme but with contributions from across the roster. The Trojans (25-8) didn’t block any shots, and they were outrebounded 41-29. The Bulldogs hardly needed help from three-point range — they hit 7 of 21 attempts — because of their assertiveness inside and an exquisite midrange game. Gonzaga had the best two-point field goal percentage in the country (63.9 entering this matchup), and USC had the best two-point defense (41.5 percent). When those two forces converged in the Elite Eight, the Bulldogs’ versatility won out.,“I know some people were worried about how he’s going to handle the size in there,” Few said of Timme. “But I think our staff and Drew and his teammates knew he was going to be fine. He’s faced many, many, many big lineups and shot blockers and such. He always figures out a way to get to his shot.”,Gonzaga’s defense, often the overlooked piece in its undefeated season, rattled the Trojans by forcing 10 turnovers and guarding the perimeter well. In Southern California’s three tournament wins, the Trojans shot better than 50 percent from long range. They made at least 10 three-pointers in their previous two victories, against Oregon and Kansas. Against the Bulldogs, the Trojans made only 4 of 15 attempts.,Less than five minutes into the game, Bert Smith, one of the officials, appeared to lose consciousness and fall to the court near the Gonzaga bench. He was immediately tended to by medical staff in a hushed arena. A few minutes later, Smith sat up and was alert. He left the arena sitting up on a stretcher, and play resumed with a standby referee joining the officiating crew. Smith didn’t need to be hospitalized, an NCAA spokesman said, and the players from both teams regrouped after the worrisome scene.,“I was just shocked and scared for him,” Few said. “But I was able to stick my head in there a little bit and see that he was talking and coherent and tried to say a quick prayer for him and wished him the best. Just told the guys we need to keep doing what we were doing prior to that.”,Southern California’s starting lineup is among the tallest in the nation, with four players at least 6-foot-7. The Trojans’ efforts on both ends of the floor are anchored by Mobley, a 7-foot freshman who led the team in scoring (16.4 points) and on the boards (8.7 rebounds). His brother, Isaiah, two years older and slightly shorter, reinforces the team’s effort in the paint with similar aptitude.,The Mobleys led the Trojans on Tuesday night — 17 points for Evan and 19 for Isaiah — but Southern California shot only 38.7 percent. The Trojans had no answers to Gonzaga’s poise and well-roundedness. Neither has any other opponent. With each performance, the gap between the Bulldogs and the field seems increasingly stark.,The Bulldogs have played in six consecutive Sweet 16s, and this year brought their fourth Elite Eight appearance in that stretch. Despite that run of dominance, Gonzaga had only made the Final Four once — in 2017, when , in the national title game. These Bulldogs, who have now won all 30 games this season and only once skated by with a single-digit margin, are gradually inching closer to what would be a perfect end to their already excellent season.",sports
https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2021/03/30/south-carolina-beats-texas-elite-eight/,South Carolina jumps on Texas early and never lets up on its way to the Final Four,"SAN ANTONIO — Dawn Staley and Vic Schaefer are used to glancing down the sideline and seeing the other in high-stakes situations. When Schaefer was at Mississippi State, the two coaches faced off in four SEC tournament championship games and in the ,.,They were at it again Tuesday, with Schaefer at the helm of No. 6 seed Texas and a trip to the Final Four on the line. Staley and top-seeded South Carolina won all five of those previous meetings and were superior again in the Elite Eight, never trailing in a , to advance to the third Final Four in program history and the first since winning it all in 2017.,The Hemisfair Region champion will face Stanford on Friday with a spot in the national championship game on the line. The other side of the NCAA women’s tournament , is already set with No. 1 seed Connecticut facing No. 3 seed Arizona.,“I’ve told [Staley], it seems like when we play them, their defense is always on point and rises to the occasion,” Schaefer said. “They always play extremely, extremely hard on that end. I thought today they were spectacular. It’s hard to win, hard to be competitive … there was three minutes to go in the third quarter and we don’t score again.,“It wasn’t just that. … They came out and punched us.”,South Carolina guard Zia Cooke put pressure on the Texas defense all night with her speed and ability to knife through defenders. She finished with 16 points, six rebounds and three assists. Victaria Saxton got loose early and contributed 12 points and eight rebounds. Destanni Henderson added 12 points and seven assists, while national player of the year candidate Aliyah Boston had a quiet 10 points and eight rebounds after averaging a double-double during the regular season and postseason.,Boston and the South Carolina defense made life extremely difficult on second team all-American Charli Collier of Texas, who finished with just four points on 2-for-10 shooting and four rebounds. Audrey Warren led the , (21-10) with 13 points and five rebounds. Texas never found any kind of offensive rhythm as it shot just 23 percent (14 for 61) from the field and 20 percent (3 for 15) from beyond the arc. Nearly every shot was contested and the Gamecocks (26-4) recorded 14 blocks, including nine from Laeticia Amihere (10 points, eight rebounds).,“We were just locked in,” Staley said. “We were a team that was driven to be where we are right now. They wanted to go to the Final Four. They want to win a national championship, and they’re going to give it up on both sides of the ball.,“I thought it was a pretty good defensive performance. But I also think Texas was a little tired. They gave every single thing they had in that Maryland game [in the previous round]. … We just never let them off the hook. That’s the kind of approach you have to take, especially when you’re playing against a Vic Schaefer team and the performance that they had two nights ago.”,South Carolina sprinted out to a 14-2 lead as Texas fell into an early hole for the second consecutive round — Maryland led 9-0 before ultimately losing to the Longhorns ,. Not only did the Gamecocks get off to a quick start, but each of their first seven baskets came off layups — including four in a row from Saxton — as the vaunted Texas defense looked out of sorts on the interior. A layup before the buzzer from Texas guard Kyra Lambert helped salvage the first quarter and cut the South Carolina lead to 18-7.,A midrange jumper and a banked-in runner from Cooke pushed the lead to 22-9, but Texas finally found its footing and began defending the interior more effectively. Texas guard Celeste Taylor led an 8-2 run that cut the lead to 24-17, and it looked as if the Longhorns were about to put together another come-from-behind effort. But the positive vibes didn’t last long.,“We haven’t started well for the past two games,” Lambert said. “After the first quarter, we were just trying to regroup, get it together on the defensive end. Credit to South Carolina. I mean, they played a great ballgame. They guarded us like we like to guard. It just wasn’t our night.”,Cooke continued to bury pull-up jumpers, and South Carolina went on a 13-2 run highlighted by another Saxton layup off a laser pass from Henderson. A three-pointer from Warren before time expired made things look a bit more respectable, but the Gamecocks still took a 37-22 lead into halftime after a dominant opening 20 minutes.,The Longhorns produced one more push in the third quarter with a 9-0 run to cut the lead to 41-31, but Texas never got within single digits the rest of the way. Staley’s crew closed the quarter on an 11-3 stretch capped by a fast-break, reverse layup from Cooke that drew gasps from the crowd and gave the Gamecocks a 52-34 advantage after three quarters.,South Carolina was so dominant that it didn’t allow a point in the final 10 minutes, the first time a team has gone scoreless in a quarter in the , since the women’s games switched to a four-quarter format in 2015.,“It’s very surreal for me,” Cooke said. “I was out there and just staring. I’m really here, really going to the Final Four. But I feel like our work isn’t done yet. I don’t want to get my hopes up too high because we still have two games to go, but I’m ready for it.,“We just played with our guard up. We knew that Texas was a good defensive team. Can’t take any team lightly. Maryland was supposed to win that game, but they didn’t. Same for this game. We were supposed to win, but it could have went the other way. We just made sure we put our foot on the gas, kept our guard up and did what we needed to do.”",sports

There was no celebration from the typically stone-faced 23-year-old as he tied his career high in points — the Wizards trailed late in the fourth quarter, after all — just a jog back down the court.,Washington lost, 114-104, to the Charlotte Hornets on Tuesday night at Capital One Arena, but if there is one thing the Wizards could take from a game in which the odds were stacked high against them from the start, it is that Hachimura seems to be coming into his own at last.,On another night without Bradley Beal, who was out for the second straight game with a right hip contusion, Hachimura stepped up alongside Russell Westbrook, leading the Wizards with 30 points. Not even counting center Thomas Bryant, who is out for the season with a torn ACL, the Wizards (17-29) were down five players, so Hachimura stepped into a starring role.,His strong performance wasn’t just for lack of other options, though; the forward has been hard-charging for some time. He entered Tuesday’s game averaging 17.5 points, shooting 52.3 percent, converting 39.4 percent from three-point range and pulling in 7.3 rebounds in 11 games since the all-star break — a considerable bump in production after an injury-laden start to the season. He attributed his uptick to two things: playing with more force on offense and Westbrook’s tutelage.,“Just [being] aggressive, especially offensively,” he said. “Even defense. . . . I can guard one through five, so I’ve just got to keep doing it. Hopefully we’ll start winning games.”,Hachimura was just as active against the Hornets (24-22) as he was against the Indiana Pacers in a win the night before, making 12 of 25 shots from the field before ceding the spotlight to Westbrook in the fourth quarter as the Wizards trailed by single digits.,“Rui, I’m telling you, he’s coming along. He still has a few more levels of getting better, and that’s the thing I love about him,” Wizards Coach Scott Brooks said. “. . . We’re going to see him become really like a high-, high-level player because he’s just learning how to play smaller players on the defensive end.”,For much of the night, it was Westbrook who set up Hachimura. The same point guard who sat during back-to-backs in the first half of the season had his second triple-double in as many nights. He followed Monday’s historic performance (35 points, 21 assists and 14 rebounds) with 22 points, 15 rebounds and 14 assists Tuesday for his league-leading 17th triple-double of the season.,Westbrook is the third player in NBA history to have consecutive games with at least 20 points, 15 rebounds and 14 assists. Wilt Chamberlain and Oscar Robertson are the others, both achieving their feats in the 1960s.,But Hachimura, Westbrook and three other double-digit scorers weren’t enough to keep Charlotte at bay after a superb start by Gordon Hayward, who had 26 points. Terry Rozier scored 27 as the Hornets shot 46.7 percent overall and 41.2 percent from three-point range, picking on the Wizards’ perimeter defense all night.,“They have a lot of guys who can score,” Hachimura said. “. . . They made tough shots, but also if they missed, when they missed, we didn’t get rebounds. We just gave up second chances; that’s what hurt us. We’ve got to be more solid. All the young guys, we’ve got to step up more, especially defensively.”,The Wizards’ scoring options were slim Tuesday after Washington added another player to its injured ranks: Backup point guard Raul Neto, who has been dealing with a left rib contusion for a few weeks but hadn’t missed a game, joined Beal, backup point guard Ish Smith (quadriceps) and forward Davis Bertans (right calf strain) on the sideline.,Recently acquired center Daniel Gafford was out, too, with a right high ankle sprain after a fall in Monday’s game. Gafford had an MRI exam Tuesday and will be reevaluated in approximately 10 days.,With the Wizards’ guard numbers thinning, rookie Cassius Winston, who is on a two-way contract and spent time in the G League bubble this season, played 11 minutes and scored three points. But it was center Robin Lopez who shined off the bench, turning in 16 points and 11 rebounds.,

For me, it’s the spring,” Smithsonian Secretary Lonnie G. Bunch III said Tuesday. “If we can open in May, that would be great. It might be early June.”,His top priority is the safety of staff and visitors, Bunch said. “We are always looking at the numbers, and they are rising a little bit,” he said.,The Smithsonian closed its buildings in November as cases began to spike in the region. When they are ready to reopen this spring, they will mimic last summer’s multiphased approach, Bunch said, with the National Zoo one of the first to come back. The phased reopening will be faster than last time, when it took two months to open eight sites.,“We won’t need as much time,” he said. “Every Friday, we could do a few more.”,The National Gallery of Art also predicts a spring opening of both its West and East buildings, according to Director Kaywin Feldman. The West Building reopened for several months last year, while the East Building remained closed for construction. The gallery’s outdoor sculpture garden, and the Smithsonian gardens, are open.,“We don’t want to reopen and reclose again,” Feldman said Tuesday. “We are watching lots of data. We are being very cautious. As I said all along, the top priority is the health and safety of our visitors and staff.”,The museum is taking its cues from the Biden administration, which is sounding the alarm about ,, Feldman said. Nationally, coronavirus cases have increased 13 percent, with the seven-day average of new cases exceeding 63,000 for the first time in nearly a month, according to Washington Post data. The city’s cases have increased, too.,“That caution is directing our considerations,” Feldman said.,Meanwhile, Planet Word, Glenstone and the National Building Museum have announced plans to bring visitors back over the next week. They join the already-open Museum of the Bible, the International Spy Museum, the National Museum of Women in the Arts and the Phillips Collection.,reopens Thursday on a reduced schedule, a decision that is based on the region’s health data and the return of many community organizations, said Executive Director Patty Isacson Sabee.,“The whole community is moving forward to open up,” Sabee said. “As more people are vaccinated, there’s a sense of optimism. It’s spring break, and people are having the ability to get out and experience things more.”,Like the other sites, Planet Word will limit capacity and require masks and social distancing. With just 200 guests admitted between 10 a.m. and 5 p.m., Sabee said, “we will be able to maintain a safe way to experience the museum.”,The ,will be open Friday through Sunday starting April 9. Tickets will be available for two sessions a day, from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 1 to 4 p.m. , opened its outdoor spaces March 4 and will reopen its indoor galleries April 8 with a ,.,The , opened in early March with a museum-wide centennial celebration, “Seeing Differently.” Director and chief executive Dorothy Kosinski said the reopening has been a balm to both her staff and visitors.,“We all have such pent-up emotions,” Kosinski said. “To be able to go into a museum, where you feel welcome and safe and there is beautiful art, provocative art, new art and old friends. You can feed your spirit and soul. Maybe now more than ever we all realize how critical and central art is to our lives.”,The reopening of the city’s museums is also critical to Washington’s comeback, said Elliott Ferguson, president and chief executive of ,, a nonprofit supporting Washington tourism. But the Smithsonian is the most important.,“It is extremely important that those museums are open, but the perception is still tied to what happens with the Smithsonians,” Ferguson said. “We are extremely excited about those that are open. We want the zoo and the other Smithsonians to open.”,Feldman, the National Gallery’s director, said the experience gained from the summer and fall will make a spring reopening easier.,“Within about two weeks, we’ll be able to organize and have everything in place,” Feldman said, referring to timed tickets and such safety protocols as masking, social distancing and managing traffic flow.,“Everyone is eager to come back, eager to experience art and that togetherness and a sense of normalcy,” she said. “I had hoped [to reopen] mid-March, and that didn’t happen. I do believe it’s getting really close.”,

But then their third-period ghosts come back to haunt them again.,The New York Rangers scored four times in the third period to complete a run of five unanswered goals and claim a 5-2 victory at Madison Square Garden.,""Tonight I just thought we were inconsistent,"" Capitals Coach Peter Laviolette said. ""We had guys that were not on the mark. Big mistakes. I thought we did fly-bys on too many pucks. We didn't compete hard enough on the pucks, turnovers, turned pucks over and big chances back in the different direction."",Washington's winning streak ended at three, but the Capitals (23-8-4, 50 points) still sit atop the East Division. Washington will face the New York Islanders, who are tied for second place with Pittsburgh with 48 points, twice during this five-game road trip — including in its next game Thursday night.,But Tuesday, the Capitals again were unable to put together a complete game, a lingering issue for this veteran team. The Rangers nearly completed a comeback from a 4-0 third-period deficit Sunday in Washington, but the Capitals held on for a 5-4 victory.,""We've just got to find a way to put 60 minutes together,"" defenseman Zdeno Chara said. ""I think most of those games we didn't put 60 minutes together, even the games that we won. For example, the last game at home, we won the game, but I don't think we have had a full 60-minute game that we wanted to play. They took over in the third period."",After a sleepy second period produced no goals and kept Washington ahead by one, the third became a battle between Capitals rookie goalie Vitek Vanecek and Rangers counterpart Igor Shesterkin. Shesterkin (30 saves) emerged victorious; Vanecek (22 saves) couldn't make the key saves down the stretch.,The third period was all Rangers. Kaapo Kakko tied the score at 2 at 4:10 with a goal that capped a pretty passing sequence on the rush. Just over two minutes later, defenseman Adam Fox put the Rangers ahead with a nifty backhander for the eventual game-winner at 6:32. Artemi Panarin delivered an insurance goal with 4:19 left after he got behind the Capitals' defense and beat Vanecek on a breakaway. Pavel Buchnevich had an empty-netter at 19:25 to seal the win.,""We've got to find a way to be able to finish these games and play stronger defensively, making stronger plays and really taking a pride in our defense and be able to finish and find a way to win these games,"" Chara said.,Winger T.J. Oshie and fourth-line center Nic Dowd had put the Capitals ahead early. Oshie scored his ninth goal with a one-timer from the slot on the power play only 2:23 in. He was in discomfort on the bench late in the game after taking a cross-check, but Laviolette had no update on his status.,Dowd gave the Capitals a 2-0 lead by scoring his seventh goal in 35 games — matching his output from 56 games last season — by hammering home the puck during a scramble in front at 4:22.,New York got its first goal after a bad turnover by Capitals defenseman Dmitry Orlov at the left point in the Rangers' zone. Filip Chytil stole the puck and raced down the ice for a clean breakaway, putting it past Vanecek at 15:36 of the first.,Washington was lucky to escape the period without further damage. Panarin had two high-danger power-play chances, with one shot hitting the crossbar.,Capitals center Lars Eller returned to the lineup Tuesday after missing seven games with a lower-body injury he suffered March 13. Eller said Tuesday morning that he suffered a setback ""in a different area"" last week that stalled his return.,""I had a setback, plain and simple,"" he said. ""As we progressed and I felt better and better, I just had a step backward and we had to settle down, rest again and then slowly progress one more time."",With Eller back,  Laviolette scratched Richard Panik and kept Daniel Sprong in the lineup. Sprong was not a regular to start the season, but he suited up for his 24th game Tuesday; he has six goals and four assists. Sprong, acquired at the trade deadline last year for defenseman Christian Djoos, filled in when forward Tom Wilson was out of the lineup during his seven-game suspension and then kept his spot in the lineup with Eller's injury.,Tuesday was Panik's first time out of the lineup this season. He has three goals and six assists in 34 games, but Laviolette has applauded his defensive abilities as well as his physical play.,""It comes down to tough decisions,"" Laviolette said. ""Richard was the odd man out today, and I think that when you are evaluating everything, you got to put yourself in a position to stay in the lineup."",

To these can be added climate disasters, humanitarian crises, terrifying gun atrocities and our nation’s increasing political discord. All are deeply serious matters, most needing energetic attention right now.,Yet knowing this, even the most activist among us will occasionally grow weary from the daily onslaught of angst. Is there no refuge, however temporary, from our brutal zeitgeist? Far too rarely does contemporary fiction and nonfiction provide the needed escape, regularly being gloomy, earnest and replete with finger-pointing and breast-beating.,At the risk of sounding unduly flippant, I want to put in a good word for books that contribute to what Samuel Johnson called “the gaiety of nations” and “the public stock of harmless pleasure.” I’m talking about wholly frivolous comic fiction.,For many readers, the first and foremost proponent of the subgenre is P.G. Wodehouse, whose accounts of upper-class twits effervesce with smile-inducing similes: “She came leaping towards me, like Lady Macbeth coming to get first-hand news from the guest-room.” Almost as well known among connoisseurs are E.F. Benson’s Mapp and Lucia novels (starting with “,”) and such humorous masterpieces as Jerome K. Jerome’s “,,” Anita Loos’s “,,” the immortal “,,” and Stella Gibbons’s “,,” which features, among its many other pleasures, old Ada Doom’s eerie, never-explained catchphrase: “I saw something nasty in the woodshed.” Still, there are many other, less familiar examples of delightfully inconsequential fiction, and one of the best is “,,” by the prolific J. Storer Clouston. It’s a perfect April Fools’ Day treat.,First published in 1899, but now available in a modern edition (McSweeney’s/The Collins Library), “The Lunatic at Large” opens at Clankwood, which “bore the enviable reputation of containing the best-bred lunatics in England.” One night, under mysterious circumstances, a new inmate, apparently named Francis Beveridge, is delivered to the asylum. Though suffering from amnesia, he turns out to be unflappably polite, irresistibly charming and quite frisky with the nurses. Think of Peter O’Toole in the film “My Favorite Year.”,Inevitably, Beveridge — who clearly isn’t deranged or in any way threatening — escapes from Clankwood and makes his way to London, where he shaves off his beard and mustache and assumes the new last name of Bunker. In need of funds, he rapidly ingratiates himself with a visiting German aristocrat, the rich, kindly and naïve Baron Rudolf von Blitzenberg, whose titles include that of “hereditary carpet-beater to the Bavarian Court.”,The lonely Baron yearns for excitement, and this his imaginative companion readily provides, one madcap or mildly risque escapade following another, culminating in the German being mistaken for a bomb-throwing anarchist. At this point, the two friends quickly repair to the holiday resort of St. Egbert’s-on-Sea.,There the Baron meets and falls in love with the beautiful Lady Alicia, which causes some temporary difficulties since she had earlier assisted the erstwhile Beveridge with breaking out of Clankwood. Aiming to advance his friend’s suit, Bunker suggests that the infatuated nobleman pretend to fall seriously ill. During a sickroom visit by Alicia and her mother, Lady Grillyer, the latter suspiciously demands, “ ‘What is the matter with the Baron?’,“Mr. Bunker saw that there was nothing for it but heroic measures.,“ ‘The dog was destroyed at once,’ he replied, with intense gravity. ‘It is therefore impossible to say exactly what is the matter.’,“ ‘The dog!’ cried the two ladies together.,“ ‘By this evening,’ he continued, ‘we shall know the worst — or the best.’ ”,Needless to say, such a smooth operator is never at a loss, even when he finally regains his memory and discovers his true identity.,Because Clouston’s book so enchanted me, I quickly acquired battered copies of its first three sequels, “Count Bunker” (1905), “,” (1922) and “The Lunatic Still At Large” (1924). Here’s a teaser for “Count Bunker.”,Five years have passed, and a somewhat plumper Baron von Blitzenberg returns to London as an attaché to the German Embassy. While happy in his marriage to Alicia, the Baron sighs for a little more fun in his life. He consequently dines secretly with his old friend Bunker and, through that trickster’s baleful influence, soon finds himself in a Scottish castle, passing himself off as its new laird, Lord Tulliwuddle. What of his Teutonic accent? A fashionable affectation, honoring the royal family’s German origins.,Before long, the Baron, assisted by “Count Bunker,” must confront not only the spectral Wraith of the Tulliwuddles but also the double temptation of a romantic highland beauty and an alluring American heiress. Meanwhile, back in London, the formidable Lady Grillyer arrives for a visit with her daughter. As Clouston reminds us, “this paragon among mothers and peeresses was a lady of majestic port, whose ascendant expression and commanding voice were commonly held to typify all that is best in the feudal system; or, in other words, to indicate that her opinion had never been contradicted in her life.” When Alicia explains that the Baron is away on a secret diplomatic mission, Lady Grillyer quickly concludes that something fishy is going on.,I’ll stop there. Rest assured, however, that Clouston unites all his characters in a frantic, Keystone Kops-like finale, with marriage vows intact and no hearts broken. On his last page, his two scapegrace heroes duly toast each other and “a creed even merrier than Socialism, more convivial than Total Abstinence, and more perfectly designed for human needs than Esperanto — the gospel of ‘Cheer up.’ ” These days, we can all drink to that.,

But that’s only scratching the surface.","None of the faces in Faith Ringgold’s “Four Women at a Table” expresses any joy. The women are clustered into a tight space, shadows fall deeply on their hair and faces, and if the two figures on either side of the table are looking at each other, it is with suspicion or some darker insinuation.,The 1962 painting, an early work by the acclaimed artist, is encountered at the beginning of a powerful survey of her career on view at the Glenstone Museum. Originally presented in 2019 at the Serpentine Galleries in London, the show traveled to Sweden and is seen here in its only U.S. venue. Bringing outside exhibitions isn’t Glenstone’s usual practice, says museum director Emily Wei Rales. But even before the death of , last summer, and the catalytic effect that had on the Black Lives Matter movement, Glenstone had made plans to host the show.,Seeing it today, while a trial examining Floyd’s death is underway in Minneapolis, is brutally hard, but also exhilarating. Ringgold emerges not just as a powerful advocate for racial justice and the equality of women, but as a prophet. And seeing a cross-section the 90-year-old artist’s career leaves one thrilled by something,else as well: the cohesiveness and persistence of her ideas, impulses and gestures, which suggests a heroic sense of purpose, a mind dedicated to gathering things up, binding them together and making them legible to as wide an audience as possible.,Consider “Four Women at a Table.” There is a narrative here, apparently one of idleness, alienation and mutual distrust, though the picture doesn’t make it explicit. But there is also a tendency to foreground geometries that carry emotional weight, the angles and arcs of looking at or past one another, and the hierarchies of height and placement of the faces within a confined frame. The heads owe something to Picasso and even more to the abstracting lines and planes of Matisse, whose green facial shadows seem to have inspired Ringgold to create analogous blue ones in these first years of her career.,Throughout the exhibition, this tendency to geometry and abstraction recurs, connecting figurative work to occasional forays into pure abstraction. Ringgold, who was raised in Harlem and supported the Black Power movement in the 1960s, is remembered in the reductive shorthand of the casual museumgoer as a political artist, and a provocative one. The display of one of her most bracing works, the 1967 “American People Series #20: Die” at the Museum of Modern Art in New York both honors and attenuates that legacy of activism: The wall-size painting is juxtaposed with Picasso’s revolutionary 1907 “Les Demoiselles d’Avignon,” with the implicit suggestion that both are disruptive, spontaneous and wild in their tenacity of expressive purpose.,But that minimizes another fact about Ringgold which becomes increasingly clear throughout this exhibition: the highly plotted and structured forms that underlie every painting or design. She is passionate about composition, making it a metaphor for understanding and thereby containing the energies her art depicts and deploys. One of her best-known works, the 1967 “American People #19: US Postage Stamp Commemorating the Advent of Black Power,” uses the Pop Art trope of a familiar, everyday object, the postage stamp, to create a grid of faces, some Black, the others mostly White. The words “Black Power” are inscribed diagonally across the grid, clearly legible. But the grid itself is structured by the words “White Power,” with the letters distended and connected, and rendered in white, and thus almost impossible to read unless you are looking for them.,The ghostly, grid-like font makes a basic statement about the hidden nature of power structures, a ubiquity and omnipresence that makes them disappear within the implied natural order of things. But it also recalls a children’s game, in which words were written with characters stretched out vertically, such that the only way you could read them was to turn the paper so that it was almost horizontal to the floor, which made the vertically distended font appear like normal print.,This game offers a simple lesson in a basic artistic skill, foreshortening. In Ringgold’s hand, it also suggests that we should, at least mentally, take her paintings off the wall if we want to see things from a new angle. That demand becomes even more explicit in her famous quilt paintings, in which the lettering on some of the quilted canvases scrolls around the work geometrically such that it is sometimes upside down, or running up and down the vertical axis. Again, the best way to see this, to read it easily, would be to remove it from the wall — if that kind of thing was allowed in an art museum.,Ringgold turned to making her quilt paintings after discovering a room of 15th-century Tibetan and Nepalese scroll paintings, or tankas, at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. Paintings that could be rolled up were easier to move and store, which she found convenient at the time. “As a woman artist, you have to manage your work itself,” she said in an interview with Hans Ulrich Olbrist published in the forthcoming exhibition catalogue.,One could fill out a good-size dissertation on Ringgold’s quilt works alone ,how they made storytelling and memory central to her work, allowing her to bypass the usual gatekeepers of narrative, and how they confounded old ideas about the line between art and craft, painting and quilting, legitimate and marginalized forms of expression. What strikes one most powerfully seeing them again, and so many of them all at once, is their intimacy. One virtue of things that are highly portable is that you can keep them close to you, and it is that quality of closeness that is most moving.,Among the exhibition highlights is the display for the first time in one gallery of a collection of nine abstract works Ringgold made in the early 1980s, after the 1981 death of her mother. She calls these paintings the Dah series, a made-up name given to them by her first granddaughter, who was learning to speak at the time. Formally, they build on the nearly abstract rendering of forests and greenery seen in some of her earlier works. The patterning also suggests the kind of camouflage we might wear if we were trying to remain inconspicuous in a forest of rainbows, silver and gold, and perpetual sunsets. They suggest paradise, or joy, perhaps the elation of discovery when a child points out something meaningful and says, simply, “that,” “there,” “yes” or “dah!”,The value of this exhibition is its accumulation of detail and insight. It doesn’t argue that Ringgold’s art is somehow more personal and intimate than we usually give it credit for, if only we could see past the politics. Rather, it adds the personal and the intimate to the activist and politically attuned sensibility. It connects the twists and turns in her life — a visit to see the Dutch masters at the Rijksmuseum leads to the discovery of tanka paintings — to her lifelong passion about justice in the world.,But it also offers something that is easy to lose sight of, the utopian “after” of political struggle. What does the better world we seek look like, when we achieve it?,The Dah series suggests it is already there, hiding in plain sight, like the pernicious words “White Power” on the postage-stamp painting she made in 1967.,

Framed as an oral history, “,” relies on a collage of voices to tell the story of Opal Jewel and Nev Charles, artists who got their start as an interracial duo in the ‘70s. Their first album was struggling when a violent tragedy drew the spotlight to them. That moment of fame as a duo was short-lived — Nev, “a goofy white English boy,” turned to more commercially popular music and sailed to solo superstardom; Opal, “an outcast Black girl from Detroit” with more experimental ambitions, has a quieter but singular career as a foremother of Afropunk whose iconic moments tend to resurface as memes.,A reunion tour promises to bring the two performers together for the first time in decades, but the personal, racial and political tensions that haunted the label and the country when they debuted haven’t gone anywhere. Walton brilliantly uses the unfolding story of the present to unspool the hidden story of the past.,Though Nev is in the title, the novel is most concerned with two women: Opal herself and SarahLena “Sunny” Curtis, the entertainment journalist who has been granted access to tell Opal’s story. Sunny’s interest in Opal isn’t purely journalistic — Sunny’s father, Jimmy, was murdered in the incident that jump-started Opal’s and Nev’s careers, and Sunny knows that Opal was having an affair with him. Opal has been a presence in Sunny’s life from the beginning: a beacon, a ghost, a void where her father might have been. “My most complicated idol,” Sunny calls her.,How wonderful it is to watch Walton build that complexity, starting with Opal’s fraught music industry debut. Opal arrives in New York facing the skepticism of the label executive who had hoped Nev would choose her buxom and more conventionally attractive sister, Pearl, as his vocal partner. Opal is skinny and dark-skinned and, because of alopecia, spent her childhood being taunted by kids who called her baldie. She’s never been taught to read music and doesn’t know much about the world she’s entering, but she knows she wanted out of her old life, and that’s all the motivation she needs. With the help of her stylist Virgil, who sees her unusual looks as a canvas for otherworldly drama, and Jimmy, her drummer and lover, who teaches her how to hear and adapt their music, she becomes a bolder, more authoritative presence. Opal is justifiably touchy when asked repeatedly about that confidence: “I understand that what people are really trying to ask me is this: ‘How in the world did a woman so black and so ugly manage to believe she could be somebody?’ ”,Opal’s confidence is hard-won and triumphant, but it’s also connected to the messier things that make her a fascinating fictional character rather than a martyr. Opal can be selfish, defensive and oblivious to what gets lost in pursuit of her own ambition or desire. The fake-documentary format gives Virgil’s and Pearl’s voices room to shine and sometimes gently push back against Opal’s story of how she invented herself. The relative absence of Jimmy’s voice — he died before anyone cared enough about Opal & Nev to document his thoughts on either of them — accumulates weight as the story continues without him. It is refreshing to read a book that centers a Black woman who has this many layers, a book that seeks neither to save her from nor punish her for the flaws that make her human.,At times, I held my breath, wondering if the novel could sustain its tightrope act — balancing its array of voices, its fictional history with actual history, its affection for Opal with the clarity of its portrait of her, its interest in Sunny herself with the story Sunny purportedly set out to tell. The first half of the book builds to a fuller account of the climactic event in the story’s past, and I wondered whether there would be enough narrative momentum left for the second half. I worried that Sunny’s own arc, primarily focused on the challenges of being the first Black editor of Aural, a legacy music publication, might start to feel sidelined or extraneous, given that it appeared only in editorial notes between the chapters.,I should have had faith: Walton structured this book masterfully. Halfway through, a major revelation about the past shifts the narrative question to the present, brilliantly spotlighting how salient history remains in a country that has never fully reckoned with racism or held its perpetrators accountable. Once we learn what happened, the book can turn its full attention to what happens next. Sunny’s professional circumstances shift, creating personal tension between Sunny and Opal, and a fascinating thematic echo in the story of two successful Black women whose power involves a balancing act between White approval and their own integrity. Even in 2016, the freedom available to Black women seeking to do things on their own terms has its price.,My only real disappointment with “The Final Revival of Opal & Nev” is that when I finished reading, I had to remind myself that Opal Jewel was fictional, and I couldn’t search the archives for her interviews, read more biographies, listen to her entire musical catalogue, and tell everyone I know to do the same. Still, I am grateful for this fictional account, which gives readers the chance to meet an unforgettable character and also provides a lens for considering the real-world artists whose stories have not yet been told in a way that centers them or gives them proper credit.,

Seemingly almost in opposition to this imagery, however, many Syrian artists have responded by creating work that is extraordinarily diverse, aesthetically rich and at times even beautiful, as a new group art show at the Middle East Institute makes clear.,“In This Moonless Black Night: Syrian Art After the Uprising” is the first significant exhibition in Washington to focus on contemporary art by Syrians. It features 14 artists, half of them women; the majority have not previously been shown in D.C. All are living in exile, whether in the United States, Europe or elsewhere in the Arab world; most left Syria at some point after the uprising that began in March 2011, although a few were living abroad already.,The uprising and what followed “kind of saw an upsurge in creativity,” according to curator Maymanah Farhat, speaking during a live-streamed preview of the exhibition. “There was a sort of release. I think with being in exile, artists have really allowed themselves to experiment.”,Themes of displacement and migration appear as a through line in multiple works, among the most immediate of which is Essma Imady’s installation “Pillar of Salt,” consisting of a child’s tiny pink backpack and teddy bear resting atop what the work’s label describes as a child’s weight in salt. While at first appearing as a simple cluster of everyday objects, it poignantly references the refugee crisis and in particular its impact on women and children.,In a recent webinar hosted by the gallery, the artist, who has interviewed Syrians in the United States and Canada about their experiences, said the installation was inspired by the concept of “looking back and being turned into a pillar of salt — how us refugees . . . have this pulling to look back, while also feeling the danger of that action.”,Four pieces by Mohamad Hafez, who was trained and has worked as an architect, feature extremely realistic, almost ­diorama-like re-creations of homes or street scenes set inside open suitcases, like miniature windows onto those worlds. Some of these “Baggage” pieces are named after and based on the lives of specific refugees to the United States who have told Hafez their stories.,“Ayman and Ghina,” which shows an elegant, blue-tinted living room, complete with a coffee table set with china, is inspired by a family from Homs who left home at a moment’s notice when they learned the army was just outside their village.,“I decided to model their living room because the day they escaped, they were in their living room, having breakfast,” Hafez says by phone from his home in Connecticut. “They left breakfast on the table. They thought they would be back in a few hours . . . and it’s been eight years now, or nine years.”,Other works grapple with migration more abstractly, such as Khaled Barakeh’s “I Haven’t Slept for Centuries.” What at first appears to be a jumble of dark black lines on a white background is in fact a digital print of superimposed visas, passport entry and exit stamps, and rejected applications to visit various countries — all personally accumulated by the artist, in a bleak commentary on the bureaucratic indignities faced by those in the Syrian diaspora.,The exhibition’s wide range — in media, form, content and tone — also highlights the country’s rich visual culture and how it has influenced its artists. Two mixed-media pieces by Bady Dalloul incorporate intricately painted old wooden gaming boards that call to mind the designs of traditional Islamic tiles or inlay. Photographs by Osama Esid of the interiors of refugee tents in camps in Turkey, lined with patterned carpets and textiles, capture how Syrians have decorated their surroundings in even the bleakest circumstances.,“I wanted the show not to aestheticize trauma, and despair and ruin,” says Farhat, adding that her aim was “to emphasize how beautiful the works are and . . . how aesthetics are so important to Syrian artists.”,Digital images of the works, including Ammar al-Beik’s short film “The Sun’s Incubator,” are available online on the gallery’s website. But the exhibition — whose title is adapted from a verse by the late Syrian poet Da’ad Haddad — is best viewed in person because of the tactile nature of much of the art and the use of varied materials.,In Kevork Mourad’s dynamic “Sanctuary City,” for example, Gothic-style illustrations of architectural elements on layers of cutout fabric are held together by threads that link the overlapping positive and negative spaces. “Cleansing” by Lara Haddad is printed on a thin fleece blanket of the type handed out by aid organizations at refugee camps, while Oroubah Dieb’s “Displacement I” and “Displacement II” incorporate patterned fabric and stationery, as well as sand, to add texture and vibrant colors to her collaged paintings of families carrying their possessions through the desert.,In marking the 10th anniversary of Syria’s uprising, “In This Moonless Night” powerfully conveys both the huge loss and remarkable resilience of Syria’s people over the past decade, through the lens of some of its most talented artists.,

A new biography presents novel details of his iconoclastic existence.,"Swollen, distorted, painted in bruised mauves and imprisoned in triptychs, the figures in Francis Bacon’s art are among the indelible images of the 20th century. In a new biography, Mark Stevens and Annalyn Swan strive to bring into focus the elusive figure of the artist himself.,There already exist pleasurably dishy memoirs of Bacon’s prime by his inner circle. Stevens and Swan, who spent a decade researching “Francis Bacon: Revelations,” aim for a more complete portrait. Bacon himself was tight-lipped about his activities before the exhibition in 1945 of his breakthrough “Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion.” He actively discouraged biographers. But Stevens and Swan are excellent investigators, presenting novel details of Bacon’s early affairs, his short-lived interior-design career and the two years he spent in Hampshire during World War II, when asthma forced his retreat from London.,The book is bejeweled with sensuous detail. We smell the Potter’s Asthma Cure in the wheezing infant Bacon’s bedroom. We glimpse “phosphorescent liquid” sprinkled on Hyde Park to divert German bomber airships away from populated zones during the Great War. We hear “the screams of men being lashed in blood-spattered cells” in the Irish prisons that young Francis trots past.,Such flourishes, which, in true Bacon style, speak “directly on the nervous system,” may well have pleased the artist. “I lived through the revolutionary Irish movement, Sinn Fein, and the wars,” he once explained, “Hiroshima, Hitler, the death camps, and daily violence that I’ve experienced all my life.” Occasionally histrionic descriptions of his life and most famous paintings are thus entirely concordant. “The most disturbing aspect of the carnage is the frenzied brilliance of the killing brush,” Stevens and Swan declare about “Three Studies for a Crucifixion” (1962). “Bacon’s painterly freedom echoes the hysterical letting-go of slaughter and blood lust.” Vivid.,Stevens and Swan suggest that Bacon’s childhood — lonely, sickly, violent, not without psychosexual drama — provided the “physical jolt” that catalyzed his art. It seems as likely that his pleasure in deviance was innate. His interest in crime, violent sex and death, all enthusiastically embraced and manifest in his work, often feel more like natural blossoms than the flowers of trauma.,Which is not to say that his life was without trauma. Parental coldness, childhood isolation, the dangers of gay life in an unsympathetic age: all must have affected Bacon. The openings of two major retrospectives were overshadowed by the deaths of lovers. But because tragic events only seemed to confirm his notions of life, one is left with the impression that he rather enjoyed a spot of devastation.,Stevens and Swan are strong on the Aeschylean patterning of Bacon’s life. The overdose of his muse George Dyer on the eve of his 1971 retrospective in Paris was, they say, a “cruel rhyme” with the death of ex-boyfriend Peter Lacy during his Tate exhibition nine years earlier — albeit with grimmer details. After securing a hotelier’s agreement to keep Dyer’s  bathroom demise quiet till after the opening reception, Bacon spent the evening at the Grand Palais with Joan Miró, Salvador Dalí and President Georges Pompidou before a painting that depicted Dyer, with dark irony, “slumped over the loo” — the very tableau he’d grimly burlesqued in death. Bacon’s “art no longer seemed an exaggeration. It was the truth, imperfectly concealed by a party.” He later returned repeatedly to the hotel where George had died — a “private ritual of expiation.”,But while his life had “moments of intense melancholy and despair,” merriment went largely uncurbed.,That merriment took place in Soho, where Bacon reigned as demon king, scarfing oysters and drinking champagne night after night. His relationship with Lucian Freud, close till Freud’s sales took off, is examined in depth, as are friendships with subjects Isabel Rawsthorne, Henrietta Moraes, and Muriel Belcher — welcome reminders that his world wasn’t just a boys’ club. Memorable, too, is Valerie Beston — “Valerie from the Gallery” — who, effectively, managed Bacon for years, perhaps saving many artworks from destruction (he was notoriously brutal with his paintings).,The iconoclastic charm of the artist keeps the pages turning. Breezily, outrageously gay when it was neither fashionable nor legal, here Bacon — whether booing Princess Margaret, declaring his attraction to Libya’s Moammar Gaddafi or bragging that he’d bought the house he’d be murdered in — is truly the nihilist-satyr of legend, “a rush of night air into England’s stuffy room.”,Bacon once said that telling his life story “would take a Proust.” A tall order — though Stevens and Swan do share a Proustian eye for the social whirl and the encroachments of “time and the wrecking ball.”,As an old man, Bacon might even be said to resemble Proust’s sadomasochistic Baron de Charlus, counting off the dead in a society completely transformed in his lifetime. One of the achievements of “Revelations” is to capture this social change alongside the life of its subject. It’s a portrait of vanished worlds, of a 20th-century style of darkness now past. Our fresh horrors await new geniuses.,

https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2021/03/31/godzilla-vs-kong-battle/,‘Godzilla vs. Kong’: Which of our big boys has the power to win?,"Part of the beauty of cinema lies in how it allows us to reflect on the most vital questions of our time — namely, if a nuclear-radiated sea monster could pummel a big gorilla, or whether that massive ape might just be the true prehistoric god-king of the earth.,Such weighty questions require careful thought, the sort that inspired the Renaissance greats to carve thinking men out of stone. One might recall these chiseled figures upon watching Alexander Skarsgard emphatically state ,, “This is our only chance. We have to take it. We , Kong. The world needs him.”,But does the world truly need Kong? Does he stand a chance against Godzilla? Before we “let them fight,” as Ken Watanabe , in 2014′s “,,” join us in admiring (and scorning) these two big boys as we make the case for which gargantuan creature should reign supreme. Their epic brawl , in theaters and on HBO Max.,Off the bat, you have to,acknowledge that Godzilla looks cooler and meaner.,But what is he? Or she?,Is it a big lizard? A dinosaur-human hybrid? Well, technically it’s a kaiju,,which translates from Japanese as “strange beast.”,Sure, the atomic-breather,of old was nothing more than , in a rubber body suit. But the lore of what Godzilla stands for,means more than any large gorilla.,The mythical monster was created as a stand-in for the fear and terror of the nuclear weapons that devastated Japanese society. Since appearing in 1954, the creature has inspired tales ranging from 1968′s monster tag-teaming “Destroy All Monsters” to the brilliant 2016 political satire “,,” which brought the threat of,nuclear peril to the modern day with the 2011 ,.,Godzilla’s depictions have spanned the globe for decades, from novels to video games. But let’s get down to the tale of the tape.,In this film canon — which began seven years ago and includes 2017′s “,” and 2019′s “,” — we’ve seen our large lad vanquish its enemy by prying open its mouth and , down its throat and disintegrate two of Ghidorah’s three heads while chewing on the third , before obliterating it for fun. And that’s just for starters.,So for this newest round, in one corner, there is a prehistoric monster that roams the land and sea who can fire off beams of nuclear energy from its mouth and has regenerative powers that allow it to swat away human weaponry like flies. Cloaked in scales, it also has an unmistakable, anguishing roar that lets you know it’s about to go down.,In the other corner, you have a big, chest-thumping gorilla who gets very easily distracted by a pretty lady.,No contest.,If “Tom and Jerry” taught us anything — the cartoon, not that ridiculous new movie with Colin Jost — it’s that size doesn’t count for everything. Speed and agility are underrated players here. If Jerry the mouse can trip Tom by tying his legs together with a string, what’s to stop Kong from doing the same with a vine from stinky Skull Island?,For those who believe size does matter, consider that Kong appears to now be the same height as Godzilla. It’s unclear what led to his practically tripling in size — perhaps it’s that he was an “adolescent” the last time we saw him, , — but facts are facts, and our boy could make a killing hawking monster PediaSure.,To address the obvious: Yes, Godzilla can blast atomic breath. But Kong is showing up to the ring with his very own Mjolnir: an ax that seems able to harness the nuclear fire as Thor’s hammer does lightning (or, at the very least, that can deflect it). We’ve established Kong’s agility, but it must also be said that he has the smarts to strategize. Godzilla, on the other hand, is quite literally operating with a lizard brain.,Not to crib from Jay-Z’s heinous verse on “,,” but an appeal for Kong is also an appeal for love. He simply does not get enough of it. We saw the kindness in his eyes when Tom Hiddleston and Brie Larson’s characters encountered him up close in “Skull Island,” and the latest MonsterVerse film embraces that trait. It introduces a story line where Kong essentially joins Rebecca Hall’s anthropological linguist character in bonding with and vowing to protect her adopted daughter, the last surviving member of the indigenous tribe that shared the island with him.,Kong is the more empathetic figure, and that goes a long way in Hollywood. He bows to no one, nor should he.",arts_culture

https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2021/03/30/john-lewis-run-graphic-novel-release/,"John Lewis’s posthumous new graphic novel will be out this summer, in time for a new battle over voting rights","Preparations for a Southern election are beginning to face fresh obstacles. Polling places are to be moved or removed and, according to at least one American leader, Jim Crow is “alive and well.”,That description is not ,, but rather from a longtime Georgian leader in his forthcoming chronicle of the civil rights movement set in the mid-'60s. If it is true that history doesn’t repeat itself but often rhymes, then the late congressman John Lewis (D-Ga.) will be returning to the national bookshelves this summer as a graphic-novel poet.,Abrams ComicArts and Good Trouble Productions have announced that the Lewis memoir “Run: Book One” — a sequel to the best-selling “March” trilogy — will be published Aug. 3. The civil rights icon completed the story before his death last July at 80, collaborating with “March” co-authors Andrew Aydin and artist Nate Powell, as well as a new member, Texas-based illustrator L. Fury, making her debut as a graphic novelist.,The cover by Powell and Fury reflects the escalation of events after , in Selma and passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act — as some run from or toward racist violence, and some run for office.,“The reason it’s called ‘Run’ is because first you march, then you run,” Aydin said by phone last week. “It’s about showing how a young person like John Lewis can go from being well-known but seen as largely radical by the vast majority of the American republic to being a public servant.”,The “March” books received critical acclaim — including the , for a comic book — while also popularizing and contextualizing a favorite Lewis phrase to urge nonviolent civil disobedience: “Make good trouble.”,“I think the congressman, particularly in the last four or five years, had his eye on how we can inspire and motivate this new generation to participate in the democratic process not just as voters, but as public servants,” said Aydin, who also worked as Lewis’s digital communications director.

Meanwhile, the segregationist violence continues, including the Mississippi murder of a wealthy Black businessman by the Ku Klux Klan.,Aydin said the longtime Georgia politician was uplifted by how many young readers embraced his life story in illustrated form: “They gave the congressman this reinvigorating energy — at conventions he got energy from them — and that’s how he knew he was on the right path.”",arts_culture

Before she embarks on the shifting perspectives that guide “,” through five generations and four countries, Garcia provides the diagrams of two matrilineal family trees.,Like the lyric narratives that follow, these family trees feature the first names of women. Abusive men damaged these trees and deadened their branches, but matriarchs are the root of these stories.,Still, mothers don’t always know what to do. “Of Women and Salt” begins with a plea from a Cuban American woman named Carmen, who begs her daughter Jeanette to find the will to endure despite traumas both inherited and experienced. “Maybe there are forces neither of us examined. Maybe if I had a way of seeing all the past, all the paths, maybe I’d have some answer as to why: Why did our lives turn out this way?”,For that, Garcia reaches back to 1866 in Camagüey, Cuba, where María Isabel becomes the first woman in her cane-cutting line to roll cigars and, soon thereafter, to read. Subjected to harassment, lesser wages and unwanted advances in a shadowy cigar factory, she becomes enraptured by books read aloud to the workers by a lector who quickly falls in love with her.,Their union, forged during a Cuban rebellion against Spanish colonial rule and slavery, ends with blood that births a new future. Liberation is not linear — not for countries nor for women. Though María Isabel “wanted to write her life into existence and endure,” not all freedoms are made possible by resilience.,“Of Women and Salt” leaps forward to 2014 in Miami. María Isabel’s great-great-granddaughter Jeanette is sleepless during a new and tremulous sobriety. Freer than she feels, Jeanette is on probation after being in rehab. Addicted to prescription drugs, she is haunted by stories that have gone untold for too long. Her brittle mother Carmen “lives among the Cuban elite, the First Wave, the people who lost homes and businesses and riches and ran from communism at the start of the revolution.”,Jeanette has never spoken to Carmen’s mother, Dolores, who still lives in rural Cuba. Riven by sexual and substance abuse, domestic violence and political tensions, their family ruptured during traumatic episodes disclosed with the flickering of time in future chapters.,María Isabel and her descendants found strength to endure, but their survival strategies relied upon silence and estrangement. Their matrilineal wisdom, which should have been a birthright for every woman born into that family, instead surfaces intermittently across the centuries. Burdened with longings shared by her ancestors, Jeanette “didn’t have the vocabulary to say,,.”,After witnessing an ICE raid that leads to her neighbor’s deportation, Jeanette gives food and shelter to a small girl named Ana, who arrives home from the babysitter to find a locked and darkened apartment. So begins the interrupted flourishing of the other family tree, planted in unstable soil whether in El Salvador, the United States or Mexico.,Ana is caught in what Valeria Luiselli described as a “hemispheric war” over drugs and arms amidst U.S. complicity in the fractured economies of Central and South America. In “,,” Luiselli writes, “Those children are refugees of a war, and, as such, they should all have the right to asylum. But not all of them have it.”,Ana’s mother, a hard-working housekeeper named Gloria, left El Salvador because of gang violence that reshaped her entire existence. As “Of Women and Salt” unfolds, U.S. immigration officials treat her family as though their lives and contributions have no value.,Fearful that her attempts to provide care might be in violation of her probation, Jeanette cannot be what Ana needs. During a deportation process meted out with “papers they won’t translate,” Gloria prays for outcomes she can’t control. “I do not want my child here, where every child has a cough and the guards run their eyes over curves, hungry. I do not want my child here but I do not want her alone thousands of miles away. I want my child safe.”,The bonds of motherhood are deep and tenuous. Though it “is ugly to admit” her pain and confusion, Gloria defines motherhood as “a constant calculation of what-if. What if we just gave up?” In “Of Women and Salt,” the women do not surrender their hopes, but they also flail against fates they never would have chosen for themselves nor their daughters.,Though “there are no real rules that govern why some are born in turmoil and others never know a single day in which the next seems an ill-considered bet,” the forces that shape these families are unmistakably patriarchal, capitalist and colonial. Against these tides of injustice, mothers and daughters fight to stay afloat, clinging to the wisdom that “we are more than we think we are.”,

It’s an affecting reminder that no matter how comfortable and settled things feel, life is always about change — changing places, changing careers and even changing loyalties.,Sweeney’s comic debut, “,,” was a breakout success in 2016. To hilarious effect, it focuses on four siblings bickering over their late father’s trust fund. “Good Company” is a sweeter novel, gentler all around, though the stakes are higher than the disappointments of a few middle-aged leeches.,Also, “The Nest” is very much a novel about living in New York, while “Good Company” is about having left it behind for Los Angeles. Sweeney made the cross-country transition herself in 2009, so she knows how questioning that decision can remain a haunting compulsion. Her new characters — actors of various kinds who have moved to L.A. — are still judging their commercial productions in La La Land against artistic endeavors in the Big Apple. For most readers, though, “Good Company” will resonate as a story about those rare choices that define life by cleanly dividing it into Before and After.,In the opening pages of “Good Company,” Flora is looking for an old photo that captures a cherished summer back in Upstate New York. Her daughter is about to graduate from high school in Los Angeles, and Flora knows the snapshot, nicely framed, would make a perfect present. But when Flora finds the picture among some old papers in the garage, she also finds the wedding ring that her husband, Julian, claimed he’d lost in a lake that summer. Its reappearance suddenly calls into question what was really going on during those August nights — and during all the years since.,“Good Company” functions very much like that beloved photo. It’s a moment caught in time, but its meaning is informed by everything around it. Flora and Julian and their friends may be smiling and looking at the camera, but that doesn’t mean they were all seeing the same thing. And this novel plays with time in a similarly complex way, moving back into the history of a small group to bring everything to bear on the perfectly staged image of “the couple everyone wanted to be.”,Flora and Julian are the exceptional theater people who seem to have done the impossible: made a stable life together. “Flora didn’t realize how much she’d invested in the mythology of her marriage,” Sweeney writes. “Like good actors, they whittled it down to a few symbolic moments that added up to the legend of Florian.”,There are no villains in “Good Company,” which only makes the theme of betrayal more poignant — and more realistic. As Flora tries to figure out what the rediscovered wedding ring means and what she’s going to do about it, we’re drawn deep into the experiences of her family and her most trusted friends, Margot and David. Over the years, they’ve grown much more successful and considerably wealthier — Margot is a TV star, David is a doctor — but the two families have never let that push them apart. What develops is a story about the twisted strands of devotion and envy that hold any long-term relationship together.,Before she got married, Flora hoped to make her mark on Broadway, and though she got a few small parts now and then, she lived the precarious life of so many part-time artists in New York. But eventually, Flora gave up her dreams, stepped away from “legitimate theater” and started doing voice-over work for commercials. Suddenly, she felt she was hovering in the confluence of her old theater colleagues’ pity and envy.,Sweeney builds that conflict between artistic purity and adult practicality right into Flora’s marriage. While she makes the sacrifices necessary to keep their family financially solvent, her husband is the co-founder of a theater called Good Company, which becomes “the defining law of their existence.” It’s a noble endeavor, to be sure, one of those high-quality, low-profit Manhattan groups with a summer stock offshoot in Upstate New York. Flora would never admit to being irritated by Julian’s success, but there’s something annoying about the way the world conforms to the desires of handsome, charismatic men like her husband. She can’t help but notice that “a group of young company members — all women, of course — fell into formation like a chorus line executing a series of perfect kicks. One became his de facto assistant, another a self-appointed company secretary, a third kept petty annoyances at bay.”,“Did you organize all this?” Flora asks him.,“No, it just kind of happened,” he replies, oblivious to his own power.,Sweeney’s effectiveness as a novelist stems from her protean sympathy, her ability to move among these characters and capture each one’s feelings without judgment. As we see some of the same events from various points of view, we don’t learn who was right — who could ever be right, after all? — but we get a poignant, sometimes comic sense of the way we each experience the same events, the same decisions, the same mistakes. In Sweeney’s hands, that’s not a recipe for endless conflict, but a road to understanding and — maybe — forgiveness.,

https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2021/03/30/tina-turner-documentary/,Tina Turner’s story has long been intertwined with Ike Turner’s. ‘Tina’ lets her have the last word.,"When Tina Turner’s fifth album, “Private Dancer,” shimmied up the Billboard chart in 1984, it was widely hailed as her comeback effort. But the singer disagrees with that assessment.,“I don’t consider it a comeback album. Tina had never arrived,” Turner says in a new HBO documentary about her life and career. “It was Tina’s debut.”,That’s a powerful statement from the musical icon, who famously kept the stage name she was given by her abusive ex-husband, Ike Turner, following their 1978 divorce. “Tina” reminds us that her name was about the only thing Turner wanted to keep from her first marriage; it was the news media that continued to make Ike Turner and his abuse a prominent focus of interviews about the singer and her work.,“Tina,” directed by Dan Lindsay and T.J. Martin, isn’t as revelatory as other , — its strength lies in context, which the filmmakers provide through archival footage and contemporary interviews with Turner; her second husband, Erwin Bach; journalists and a few friends, including Oprah Winfrey.,Here are the biggest takeaways from the nearly two-hour film.,The documentary recalls Turner’s fateful trip to see Ike Turner’s band play in St. Louis in the late ’50s. She asked that night if she could join him onstage, but Ike refused because “he didn’t believe I could sing,” Turner recalls in audio from a 1981 interview with People magazine. Turner continued to show up to the band’s gigs, and eventually Ike relented. Her voice, full-bodied and husky, blew him away.,At just 17, Turner began singing with the band every weekend. “I was young, naive — just a country girl,” Turner recalls in a contemporary interview. “And everything just opened up to me.”,Initially, as Turner recalled in her People interview, their relationship was based in “a family love.” But when the duo landed their first hit record, “A Fool in Love,” in 1960, Ike rebranded his band as the Ike & Tina Turner Revue — and decided that Tina should be his wife.,“She really was young. She had no ambition to be a superstar,” recalls Jimmy Thomas, who sang background vocals for the revue. “But when she sang, she just had it. And Ike exploited it.”,In her interview with People, Turner noted that Ike — who had gone uncredited on “Rocket 88,” the pioneering rock-and-roll record he recorded with his band in 1951 — had deep-seated insecurities about being left behind by acts that he’d helped to find fame.,Turner was pregnant with her and Ike’s son, Ronnie, when she disagreed with travel arrangements Ike had planned for the band.,He responded by beating her with a shoe stretcher, Turner said in her People interview. His abuse continued until she left him in 1976. “Maybe I was brainwashed. I was afraid of him, and I cared what happened to him. And I knew that if I left, there was no one to sing,” Turner says in the audio.,As Turner’s star rose, Phil Spector, then an influential record producer, asked to work with Turner — and only Turner. Though their first collaboration, the 1966 single, “River Deep — Mountain High,” was considered a commercial flop (in the United States at least), Turner got a taste of freedom working with Spector, who encouraged her to branch out from beyond how she typically performed with Ike. (Though, Ike is credited on the song as part of a deal with Spector.),“It was so big, and my voice sounded so different standing on top of all that music,” Turner says of the song.,At this point, Turner says she no longer loved Ike. But she continued to work with him out of loyalty, and was determined to help him get a hit record. She achieved that with the duo’s Grammy-winning cover of Creedence Clearwater Revival’s “Proud Mary” in 1971, though the song only amplified the pressure for success. Ike’s abuse, meanwhile, intensified.,Turner credits her introduction to Buddhism with helping her become confident enough to leave Ike. She reached her limit in 1976 when he struck her on the way to a Dallas airport. The incident informed a memorable scene in the 1993 film “What’s Love Got to Do With It,” which starred Angela Bassett as Turner. In the scene, Tina fights back after Ike strikes her; in real-life, Turner did the same, but after arriving at the hotel bloodied and swollen, she massaged Ike’s head so he would fall asleep.,It was then that Turner made a desperate escape, across a freeway, to a nearby hotel. “I grabbed my little hand luggage and I walked,” Turner recalls in her People interview. “I was afraid, though.”,“Tina” recalls Turner’s packed work schedule following her divorce from Ike, in which she says she “got nothing” except for her name. “That’s when I realized I could use Tina to become a business,” Turner recalls.,The next few years were filled with performances in Las Vegas and on TV specials in a bid to recoup the money she lost in the divorce fallout, which included canceled gigs. Turner eventually recruited Roger Davies to be her manager, leading to higher profile gigs — even as she,encountered vile racism within the music industry — and the new sound that marked a departure from her work with Ike.,Turner’s interview with People music editor Carl Arrington ran in the magazine’s Dec. 7, 1981, issue, and marked the singer’s first public comments on her ex-husband’s abuse. But even after Turner reached the height of her solo career with the Grammy-winning “Private Dancer” (followed by a role in the 1985 film “Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome”) the singer was constantly asked about Ike and their relationship.,Turner attempted to put those discussions to rest with her 1986 autobiography “I, Tina,” which she co-wrote with Kurt Loder. But the effect was largely the opposite, partially because other women were so inspired by her coming forward.,“That story reached so many people who felt like they had to kind of keep their secrets locked away deep down,” Katori Hall, the , to Broadway, says. “It’s like a Pandora’s box.”,“Tina” is mostly devoted to the singer’s career, but it does briefly discuss her childhood in Nutbush, Tenn., where her family picked cotton and where she witnessed her father’s violence against her mother. Eventually, both of her parents abandoned the family altogether.,“I’m a girl from a cotton field that pulled myself above what was not taught to me,” she says in an archival interview with Loder.,“I have not received love almost ever in my life. I did not have it with my mother and my father from the beginning of birth, and I survived,” she tells him. “Why did I get so far without love … I have had not one love affair that was genuine and sustained itself. Not one.”,Turner tells Loder, pounding her fist on the table for emphasis, that she’s experienced “tons of heartbreak.”,“I’ve analyzed it. I’ve said, ‘What’s wrong with me?’” Turner says. “I’ve looked in the mirror with myself stripped of makeup and without hair. Why can’t someone see the beauty in the woman … I am?”,The documentary’s final act introduces Turner’s husband, Erwin Bach, and their sprawling estate in Zurich. “I really needed love. I just needed to love a person,” Turner says, recalling their first meeting when the former record executive picked her up from Düsseldorf Airport in Germany.,“It’s love. It’s something we both have for each other,” says Bach, whom Turner married in 2013. “I always refer to it as an electrical charge.”,As for her ex-husband, who died in 2007, Turner says she has forgiven him. “Forgiving means not to hold on,” she says. “You let it go.”,“I had an abusive life. There’s no other way to tell the story,” she adds. “It’s a reality. It’s a truth.”,The documentary fittingly ends with footage of Turner attending the premiere of Hall’s musical, where she received a standing ovation. The documentary and the play, Bach says, “is a closure.” As Turner eyes her future away from public life, she reflects on the most graceful way to do it.,“Some people say that the life that I lived and the performances that I gave, the appreciation is lasting with the people and I should be proud of that,” she says. “I am. But when do you stop being proud? How do you bow out slowly?”",arts_culture

He was 81.,The cause was complications from Parkinson’s disease, said his wife, Lore Willner Dickstein. Dr. Dickstein taught for four decades at the City University of New York, where he founded the Graduate Center’s Center for the Humanities.,Dr. Dickstein was part cultural historian, part literary critic. His emergence followed the postwar heyday of the public intellectual, when such heavyweights as Irving Howe, Irving Kristol and Nathan Glazer battled for ideas in pages of magazines such as Dissent and Commentary and embodied what writer Jonah Raskin , as a “mystique” that extended far beyond the salon and ivory tower.,“We could round up the usual suspects,” Dr. Dickstein remarked, endeavoring to explain the forces that had conspired to push him and his colleagues to the margins — “the turn toward theory, jargon, professionalization; the decline of the centrality of literature among the arts, followed by the decline of book culture itself; the separation of academics from the wider world of general readers; the collapse of literary journalism.”,The Internet was a principal culprit, he added, “offering worldwide distribution but substituting the gripes and hosannas of ordinary readers for the authority of trained and experienced critics.”,A self-described “freethinking intelligence yet a child of the ghetto,” Dr. Dickstein was the son of Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe. He spent his boyhood on the Lower East Side of New York and eventually studied at Columbia, Yale and the University of Cambridge under the most renowned of those trained and experienced thinkers — among them F.R. Leavis, Lionel Trilling and Harold Bloom.,In his own books and prolific writings, which appeared in newspapers including the New York Times and journals such as Partisan Review, Dr. Dickstein eschewed the hyper-academic style that had driven readers away from literary criticism not because the readers were unintelligent, but because the critics were unintelligible. (Remarking on developments in his profession, he wryly observed that “criticism of criticism now has its own comfortable niche.”),Instead he sought to cultivate a style that was erudite but accessible to readers engaged with the world of culture. Unlike colleagues who wielded their pen like a drill, boring a hole ever deeper into a single rarefied topic of interest (or noninterest), Dr. Dickstein displayed an intellectual virtuosity, exploring the works of writers as varied as the English Romantic poets and the Beat Generation. In typical fashion, he drew an unexpected connection between the two groups.,Dr. Dickstein said he fell in love with Romantic poets such as John Keats for the very reason they had earlier fallen out of favor with T.S. Eliot and critics of his ilk. “The Romantics were seen as loose and undisciplined in their language, their morals, their urgent strength of feeling,” Dr. Dickstein told Raskin, explaining the objections. With such qualities, though, he said the poets prepared him for his study of the 1960s, the subject of one of his best known books.,“,” (1977) was Dr. Dickstein’s first major work, an examination of a decade that, as he wrote, produced “one of those deep-seated shifts of sensibility that alter the whole terrain.”,He probed what he regarded as the enduring brilliance of Norman Mailer’s New Journalism, the poetry of Robert Lowell and the comic novels of , in commentary that he leavened with personal confessions. ,Tom Wolfe’s 1968 book “The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test” was “stupefyingly boring,” he wrote. “I got through only half of it.”,The result, Times book critic Dwight Garner , in 2009, was “a book warmed by [such] injections of his own experiences during the decade and by his willingness occasionally to shoot from the hip.”,Dr. Dickstein examined his own profession in “,” (1992), then delved into literary history in “,” (2002). He published “,” (2005) before turning to the Depression in the cultural history “,” (2009).,That book, a finalist for a National Book Critics Circle Award, was a collection of writings on the works of authors such as John Steinbeck, filmmakers such as Frank Capra, composers including George Gershwin and photographers such as Dorothea Lange. “These admirably written pieces,” the critic , wrote in , for the Los Angeles Times, “are marked by a generosity of spirit that never deteriorates into the quarrelsome.”,Morris Dickstein was born in Manhattan on Feb. 23, 1940. He lived on the Lower East Side until he was 9 and then moved to Queens, where his mother and father, who came from Ukraine and Poland, respectively, ran a dry goods store.,His parents sent him to a yeshiva, although he would later resist the restrictions of Orthodox life. In a memoir, “,” (2015), Dr. Dickstein described his personal evolution as an “education of the feelings as well as the mind, a journey from one world to another, from an immigrant Jewish family to a secular, cosmopolitan society, a coming of age in a culture that was itself going through startling transitions that inevitably carried me along.”,He obtained a scholarship to attend Columbia, where he received a bachelor’s degree in English in 1961. He then enrolled at Yale, where he received a master’s degree in English literature in 1963 and, after studies in England at Clare College Cambridge, a doctoral degree in 1967. (The adviser for his thesis, a study of Keats, was Bloom.),Dr. Dickstein taught at Queens College before joining CUNY in 1974. He retired in 2013.,Besides his wife of 56 years, of Manhattan, survivors include two children, Jeremy Dickstein, also of Manhattan, and Rachel Dickstein of Brooklyn; a sister; and four grandchildren.,At its most essential, Dr. Dickstein saw his responsibility, and that of any critic, to reveal the “sea of hype” upon which he found many books, films and other works of art to be bobbing along. “Only when you read a serious review do you see the issues underneath,” he , in 1998. “Criticism plays a very important role in keeping people honest.”,

Nike is suing.,"Adorned with a pentagram and the number 666, the sneakers would stand out even if you didn’t know what they supposedly contained: a drop of human blood.,The bodily fluid from employees of , mixes with ink to fill an air bubble in each pair of the “Satan Shoes,” a new collaboration with rapper Lil Nas X that has ignited the Internet with a mixture of shock, disgust and amusement.,The kicks are transformations of Nike Air Max 97s and are pegged to the release of Lil Nas X’s new single, , whose video includes the singer sliding down a pole into hell and gyrating on top of the devil while singing seductively ,.,“We always talked about doing the Satan Shoes internally and when Nas told us about his new song we knew it was a match made in heaven (or better yet hell),” Daniel Greenberg, one of MSCHF’s founders, wrote in an email.,Nike on Monday sought to indicate its stance on the kicks in the clearest way possible: It launched a federal lawsuit asking the court to have the sneakers destroyed.,In the complaint filed in the Eastern District of New York, the behemoth athletic wear company referenced social media backlash from people who vowed never to buy Nike products again because of the Satan Shoes. The lawsuit alleges trademark violations by MSCHF and demands that the prank company relinquish to Nike any profits that it made from selling the sneakers.,“This was done without Nike’s approval or authorization, and Nike is in no way connected with this project,” the company wrote.,Representatives of MSCHF did not respond to a message seeking comment on the lawsuit.,The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office declined to answer a question about whether the company could face legal repercussions for marketing the sneakers. And the Consumer Product Safety Commission did not respond to questions about the safety of the product containing human blood, which can carry viruses.,Each pair of Satan Shoes is decorated with small inverted crosses and the phrase , a biblical passage that references Jesus seeing “Satan fall like lightning from heaven.” Red numbering on the back of each shoe identifies it as belonging to one of 666 pairs that MSCHF is selling for $1,018 each. Typical Air Max 97s sell for about $100 to $200.,By Monday afternoon, , said all but one pair had been sold and the last would be distributed Thursday by lottery.,The sneakers are a follow-up to , that the company offered for thousands of dollars in 2019, Greenberg said. The firm’s other hits include ,, , and ,.,Unlike some of MSCHF’s other projects, the shoes are more than just a gimmick. The devil theme is a sarcastic play on public criticism that Lil Nas X says he has received for being gay. The 21-year-old rapper, whose legal name is Montero Lamar Hill, has said he wrote “Montero (Call Me By Your Name)” ,, who had “promised to die with the secret” of his sexuality.,“People already demonize who I am and put me in a painting of, ‘Okay, he’s evil, he’s doing this, he’s doing that,’ ” Lil Nas X ,. “So it’s like, you know what? I’ll take that. I’ll be that, and I’m going to make the best of it.”,Backlash to the shoes largely centered on the idea that the product promotes evil.,“Our kids are being told that this kind of product is, not only okay, it’s ‘exclusive,’ ” , South Dakota Gov. Kristi L. Noem (R). “But do you know what’s more exclusive? Their God-given eternal soul. We are in a fight for the soul of our nation. We need to fight hard. And we need to fight smart. We have to win.”,Televangelist Mark Burns , that the Satan Shoes are “a reason why we Christians must be prayed up ready to battle in the spirit with the Voice of the Holy Spirit. This is evil & heresy and I pray that Christians rise up against this.”,In a nod to the outrage, Lil Nas X published , in which he suggests that he’s about to renounce the shoes before the screen cuts to a shot from the music video of him crowning himself with Satan’s horns. The singer also took a swipe at fast-food restaurant Chick-fil-A, which has donated to organizations that oppose same-sex marriage, with , tailored to the business.,Sneakers, which have been , for decades, have become signifiers of cultural relevance and common collectors’ items. Elizabeth Semmelhack, senior curator at the Bata Shoe Museum in Toronto, said she expects that some consumers who rushed to buy the Satan Shoes will turn them around for a profit on the resale market, where the media hype will make the sneakers valuable commodities.,But Semmelhack said other customers will inevitably be drawn to the narrative tied up in the shoes. In addition to their shock value, she said the sneakers seem to reflect Lil Nas X’s frustration with his treatment as a gay man.,“I think the message that he’s trying to send is more complicated and deserving of a larger discussion than it being simply a marketing ploy,” Semmelhack said. “He is making a comment about society.”",arts_culture

And bat she did. It took 12 years of acting for Sharon Stone to hit the big time, but success when it came, with “Basic Instinct,” was huge. Acclaim and award nominations followed for “Casino,” “The Mighty” and “The Muse.” A brain hemorrhage nearly killed her in 2001, but she recovered, then modeled for Dior. She’s raised millions for HIV/AIDS research and worked tirelessly to help homeless people in Los Angeles. She accepted the Peace Summit Award from the Dalai Lama in 2013.,Now 63, Stone has stepped back up to the plate with a candid memoir, “,.” While it contains some startling personal revelations, equally affecting is Stone’s warmth and grace, qualities that, by the end, feel quite miraculous. “I have learned to forgive the unforgivable,” she writes. “My hope is that as I share my journey, you too will learn to do the same.”,Her childhood was outdoorsy: concrete-pouring, barn-painting, treehouses. “I grew up hangin’ with the guys.” Her parents “did a horrible, beautiful, awful, amazing job.” There was laughter, there was violence. Although she had a difficult relationship with her mother, and her father sometimes beat her, she’s nostalgic for the blue-collar Pennsylvania of her youth: “There is still something about the sound of a screen door banging.”,Starting young, she was harassed: by a boy in the playground, her high school science teacher, her manager at McDonald’s. As a teenager, she had an abortion, the consequence, she suggests, of gaps in her sex education.,But, as she reveals here for the first time, there was another kind of trauma in Stone’s childhood, too. This, she writes, is the “brave time where we can and will say this out loud.” She and her sister were subjected to repeated sexual abuse at the hands of their grandfather, incidents that ended only with his death when Stone was in her teens.,The consequences were, naturally, devastating: “We lost a lifetime of love, of our family.” The details she presents, while vivid, are not prurient. And, anticipating the inevitable headlines, they come with a judicious reminder to reviewers and commentators. “Generation after generation,” she writes, “we will still be learning just how to talk about and deal with abuse without being abusive in our very discussions, sensationalistic in our interest, cruel with our concern.”,Like many survivors of abuse, Stone found it difficult to escape its control, even after her grandfather’s death. Only since she’s been able to speak to other survivors — and to her mother, who says she was unaware of what was going on — does Stone feel that she and her family can be “present with one another. The real brutality of that is that it is decades later.”,Coming out the other side: This could be the “living twice” of the book’s title. But living twice is also the liberation that comes from ceasing to chase some “idea that developed centuries ago.” It’s the growing primacy of Stone’s own truth, her increasing impatience with the old patriarchal order. It’s emerging alive from a major neurological event, despite a 1 percent chance of survival. “There is something that happens when you start over, live again,” she writes. “A kind of mystery unraveling.” The mystery, perhaps, of why we ever accepted things the way they were.,A compulsion to unravel — to demystify — drives her eviscerating portrait of Hollywood. “Many people ask me what it was like in my days of being a superstar,” she writes. “It was like this. Play ball or get off the field, girl.” She’s seen it all, from the petty (the line producer on “Basic Instinct” who called her Karen and reminded her that she was the 13th choice for the part) to the downright sick (the director “who wouldn’t direct me because I refused to sit in his lap to take direction”). Amazingly, it’s “the ones who have threatened to fire me if I didn’t put out” who are “the less violent trespassers of my personal space.”,But Stone doesn’t name names. “We are ready to sing a new story,” she writes, “and this now is how I am going to sing it.” Positive action; a road map. There are resources and guidance for survivors of sexual and domestic abuse. Writing with zeal and urgency, Stone argues for a stronger legal system, for rape kits on police shelves to be processed, for better training for teachers and pediatricians. Above all, she offers a hopeful glimpse of life beyond trauma. “Today, my mother and I are at the beginning of our relationship,” she says. “If I hadn’t finally stopped keeping this horrible secret, I would never have known her.”,“The Beauty of Living Twice” promises the possibility of improvement or redemption, of compassion and understanding, of living honestly. Stone dedicates the book to her mother, herself a survivor of childhood abuse, and suggests she might yet, in her 80s, be “the torch that carries the light for women of her generation who are no longer afraid to stand up and be counted.” It’s a hopeful, urgent message.,

People have seen me literally every single day lead the country's fight against Covid and I have literally spent almost every waking moment doing that.,""I will continue to do that for every single day that is required out of that crisis, because it is not over yet."",But she added: ""Recovery is not a neutral thing. ,""So long as so many of the decisions lies in the hands of Boris Johnson and Westminster, then the danger is we take the wrong decisions and go in the wrong direction just as we've been dragged out of the EU against our will."",This debate was a reminder of the major fault line in Scottish politics - independence or continued union. ,More than six years after the referendum, Nicola Sturgeon confirmed she is aiming to hold another vote in the first half of the next term at Holyrood.,She qualified that by saying this timescale depends on the Covid crisis being past but it's not clear how that will be determined.,The Greens also support indyref2 but avoided being tied down on timing. ,The three other parties - Conservatives, Labour and the Liberal Democrats made their opposition to a referendum clear. ,But the Tory leader Douglas Ross was determined to outdo the others, going as far as saying he did not want to work with the SNP because of independence. ,That prompted Labour's Anas Sarwar to urge him to ""grow up"". ,This election is not just a choice of first minister - there's also a lively debate between those for whom a strong second place finish would be a good result.,But Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said the coronavirus vaccination programme showed the strength of the United Kingdom when it worked together. ,He said more than half of all Scottish adults have now had their first does of vaccine, and added: ""The United Kingdom getting the vaccines that are delivered by our NHS staff, our British armed forces and volunteers. That's the union working for people right now."",Mr Ross asked: ""Why do we have bills in the Scottish Parliament to take forward another independence referendum, but not bills in the Scottish Parliament to support education, to help businesses, to protect jobs?,""None of that is happening because the Scottish government and the SNP are focused on another independence referendum."", On 6 May, voters in Scotland will elect 129 Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs). The party that wins the most seats will form the Scottish government. , MSPs pass laws on most aspects of daily life in Scotland, such as health, education and transport. They also have control over some taxes and benefits. Defence, foreign and immigration policies are decided by the UK Parliament., Anyone who lives in Scotland and is registered to vote is eligible, so long as they are aged 16 or over on the day of the election. You can ,. ,Meanwhile, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar highlighted the case of a tertiary cancer patient who had been told she would not be treated in Scotland.,Mr Sarwar said this was because the backlog due to Covid meant operations were only being done on first cancers, and not recurring cancers, so the woman had to travel to England for treatment.,He said: ""That is what should be getting us exercised in this debate today. That is what we should be obsessing about, and that is what the recovery plan needs to be about.,""These are the things that matter to people across the country. They don't care about the badges or the name calling. They care about having services that work for them - what Scotland can do, not what Scotland can't do"". ,But Ms Sturgeon's position was backed by Ms Slater, who said the Scottish Green manifesto would commit to a referendum taking place in the next Holyrood term.,Ms Slater said: ""Around the room we hear people who are in favour of the Union not actually arguing for the Union, but instead arguing that the people of Scotland shouldn't have the right to choose.,""The Scottish Greens would support a referendum in this term of parliament because we think decisions about Scotland should be made by the Scottish people."",Ms Slater said the pandemic had shown that Scotland's economy was propped up by low wages, insecure work and a social security system that is full of holes.,And she said science showed that the planet had less than a decade before the climate breakdown would go past the point of no return - and argued that we ""can't go back to this broken system"" after the pandemic.,Mr Rennie, the Scottish Liberal Democrat leader, said more than 1,500 young people were having to wait more than a year for mental health support. ,And he said the pandemic had also highlighted the need to improve the country's care sector, and the lack of support for schoolchildren who had lost out on education. ,He said: ""I've seen a window into the next five years in the last few weeks - arguments over the constitution, strategy about independence, arguments between Nicola Sturgeon and Alex Salmond which have been poisonous and unpleasant.,""What we need to do is to put all of that behind us and choose a different future. ,""And if we can do that we can tackle mental health, we can tackle education, but we can also make sure our social care workers get the pay they deserve."",If you are reading this page on the BBC News app, you will need to visit the mobile version of the , to submit your question on this topic.

Alongside new devolved powers came an opportunity to shout loudly again for the capital.,For London's mayor, there was a chance to fashion a distinctive leadership role. It was not one that could be defined precisely, but over two decades it has come to mean many things.  ,Mayors have articulated responses to both crisis and celebration. ,In July 2005, Olympic triumph and terrorist tragedy became entwined in 48 hours of euphoria and mayhem. ,On 7 July, four suicide bombers with rucksacks full of explosives ,.,They killed 52 people and injured hundreds more. It remains London's worst single terrorist atrocity.,It was an examination not just of the resilience of the city itself, but of the qualities of the politician elected to speak for it. ,At the time, and again when recalled on the 10th anniversary in 2015, ,. ,Ken Livingstone was in Singapore, with London just having won its bid to host the 2012 Olympics.,His speech, hastily put together in a hotel lobby, was an evocative blend of the language of shared defiance with a sense of the unfolding practical response from the emergency services - who were working together closer than ever as part of devolved city government. ,The protocols around communication in response to acts of terror in the capital are still built primarily around the prime minister and the Metropolitan police commissioner.,But is it to the mayor that Londoners now look for reassurance?,It is now an essential part of the mayoral job specification to be able to capture tone and mood, and reflect Londoners' collective pain and pleasure. ,One notable feature over the two decades has been mayoral defiance, characterised by bullishness towards the media and opponents, and a refusal to say sorry. ,For a brief moment in 2005, the capital was even without a mayor after Ken Livingstone , after a City Hall party. ,Mr Livingstone - by now a Labour mayor after defying the party to win as an independent in his first term - was suspended from office. He was soon reinstated after a , effectively found he had the right to be offensive and didn't have to apologise.,Such was Mr Livingstone's disdain for the Evening Standard - at a time of unremittingly hostile coverage - that he couldn't find a detached, apologetic tone that might have ,. The allegations were later dismissed.,During the 2012 London Olympics, Boris Johnson took international (self?) promotion to new and dizzying heights, when he became suspended on a zip-wire in Victoria Park in east London. ,Some blamed the Conservative mayor's weight and a technical malfunction.  ,But - going against the guidance of the operators - ,, rather than folding them across his chest. ,Investigating afterwards, Tower Hamlets Council's environmental health team found nothing wrong with the equipment.,Surely this wasn't part of a plan?,Three years later in Japan, a demonstration of street rugby in Tokyo was coming to an end when Mr Johnson turned to begin his last run. ,With two UK photographers well known to him ideally positioned, ,Could anyone ever prove this was deliberate? Yet the desired effect was achieved. ,An international trip of otherwise minimal consequence was eclipsed by a viral video - with London and its mayor duly promoted across the globe.,All three mayors have been in the beam of the international spotlight on occasion. ,The current mayor has, er, trumped the lot. ,As the president of the United States touched down at Stansted airport at the beginning of his official visit in June 2019, a couple of tweets landed with him.,They labelled Sadiq Khan as a ,.,Forget zip-wires - wasn't this hitting the political jackpot? ,Mr Khan had first , for proposing a temporary travel ban for Muslims coming into the US.,It is a notable PR triumph when the most powerful politician on the planet, however unusual, knows who you are and can be bothered to attack you.,Mr Khan, previously a Labour MP, had already come to widespread attention as the first Muslim elected to lead a Western capital.,But the spat fitted with his aspirations. ,Ken Livingstone did a highly unusual deal with Venezuela's Hugo Chavez.,He organised , in return for Transport for London (TfL) officials sorting out the traffic problems in Caracas. ,But while making a visit to Venezuela, Mr Livingstone only got as far as Cuba, before Mr Chavez called off their meeting because of an election campaign.,There was no meeting either with the ailing Cuban leader Fidel Castro, leaving Mr Livingstone to sit reading a biography of former Vietnamese premier Ho Chi Minh in the gardens of Havana's National Hotel before flying back - to the glee of his Tory opponents.  ,All three mayors have clearly seen themselves as international players. ,Eloquent in his belief that cities drive progress, Mr Livingstone was the prime force behind the C20 - now expanded to the C40.,It's a network of major world cities pooling ideas and their combined urban spending power to drive innovation in tackling climate change.,Under Mr Johnson, though, London lost its leadership position in the group.,In 2009, at its annual international conference in South Korea - attended by Bill Clinton - Mr Johnson was sidelined and sloped off for a sightseeing trip to the demilitarised zone at the 38th parallel.,Over 20 years, the mayoralty has undoubtedly hit turbulence from time to time.,Conflicts between the last mayor and the current one - who is now of course the prime minister - raise doubts about how , planning, housing and policing in the capital. ,About 17% of the mayor's £17bn budget come from government grants.  ,Can a pugilistic approach work in a country where mayors rely heavily on central government for their resources?,It feels like the time for a reappraisal.,As for the office-holders, what unites them is showing, more than occasionally, a distinctly independent streak.",politics

There are some technical differences with the EU system and each side has targeted a slightly different list of people. ,In March, the UK and the EU , on a virtually identical group of Chinese officials accused of persecuting the Uyghur in Xinjiang, prompting Beijing to sanction , in return.,The foreign secretary said that there might not be that much difference between the UK and the EU in future, writing to the House of Lords: ""International co-operation will remain at the heart of UK sanctions policy."",In February, the United States agreed to temporarily cut the taxes which had been slapped on , in a long-running dispute about the manufacture of planes.,The prime minister celebrated, saying: ""It shows what the UK can do as an independent trading nation."" ,The very next day the EU received the same treatment, with the US cutting tariffs on tractors, wine and cheese. ,Sources close to the International Trade Secretary Liz Truss say that Brexit meant she could drop the UK's tariffs on the US, to encourage the Biden administration to come to the negotiating table.,They said it is surely no coincidence the 16-year dispute ended just weeks after the UK took control of its trade policy. ,""We want to reward the work farmers do to manage every metre of hedgerows on their holdings sustainably,"" Environment Secretary George Eustice told the Oxford Farming Conference in February.,He said farmers previously could not apply for money to help protect hedgerows from the EU's Common Agricultural Policy because they were dubbed ""ineligible features"".,This would change with the UK's post-Brexit Sustainable Farming Incentive, the government claims. ,The National Farmers Union say that's not strictly accurate because some hedgerows were recognised previously, and there was also a separate British grant scheme for them. ,Hence the environment secretary's careful reference to ""every metre"" in the new scheme, which won't be fully in place until 2028. ,The UK is still very early in its post-Brexit journey. And - as usual - nothing in this debate is quite as simple as it first appears.,And while looking at these ""quick-wins"" is an interesting intellectual exercise, it's a difficult one because we can't drop into a parallel universe where the UK is still in the EU to see what might be different.

Just before the pandemic hit, that number had reached almost 44,000.  ,Cases are taking longer to resolve and that, in turn, makes the system more expensive, as the Home Office has to house and feed people who are not allowed to work while they wait for a decision on their futures. ,And so these statistics lead critics to say that the real problem remains fundamental mismanagement of asylum over decades. ,Let's take the core proposal to treat some asylum seekers differently to break the power of criminal gangs. ,Anyone coming via proposed new official routes, such as the recent Syrian resettlement scheme taking people from camps, would be fast-tracked into a new and permanent life in the UK. ,Just putting to one side the fact that we don't know what these officials routes are, anyone who doesn't use them may be relying on people smugglers. ,The UK will restrict that group of people's rights to live a normal life and try to send them back to other safe countries they have passed through along the way. ,Those it can't eject will never get permanent residence and will face repeated attempts to remove them in the years that follow. ,The aim is to undercut the awful criminal economy of smugglers who profit from misery as they pack people onto boats.  ,Many legal experts predict the plan would breach the international law that the UK helped devise - that states we should treat all asylum seekers equally and fairly.,But officials think that's not quite the point and there is room to create sanctions to break the link with criminal gangs.,, countries can't penalise refugees for illegally entering a nation, providing they come ""directly"" to its shores, or have a good explanation for how they have turned up via some more complicated route. ,But while an asylum seeker is not obliged to seek sanctuary in the first safe country they reach, nor do they have an unfettered right to shop around. ,The Home Office seems confident that provides the legal room for it to take steps against asylum seekers who have paid smugglers, in the hope that it will deter others from doing the same.  ,Just supposing all of this becomes law, there is an elephant trumpeting away in the Home Office's shiny glass atrium: where is the UK actually going to send anyone whom it wants to get rid of?,The number of people being removed from the UK - be they failed asylum seekers or, separately, foreign national criminals, has been falling over a decade. ,And the UK has not been able to send a single failed asylum seeker to its immediate neighbours since the end of Brexit, when it left the EU-wide system governing such transfers. ,There is no new legal agreement in place - and there is no way that the UK can force France, Italy, Greece or wherever else to receive people without permission. ,The Home Office hopes to strike new deals - but until it does so there is the possibility, say some experts, that the plans will just make matters worse. ,If attempts to discourage people from using smugglers fail, people will still be turning up, but now without the right to settle permanently and put down roots. ,Denied benefits or the right to work under the planned restrictions, they could end up destitute. ,And if they can't be sent anywhere else, they may remain on the streets, in limbo. ,Just like Tony Blair's government, the challenge for this Home Secretary is to have enough time to prove that the system she says is broken is on its way to being mended.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-56515028,Coronavirus: Is it time for a new Beveridge report?,"Almost 80 years since Sir William Beveridge published his plans for a new system of ""cradle to grave"" social security, politicians on the left and right are trying to claim the spirit of the Beveridge era as they sketch out plans for life after the pandemic. ,At his party conference last year, Boris Johnson described how, in the depths of World War Two, the National Government had set out a vision for a New Jerusalem. ,And in a speech last month, Labour's leader Sir Keir Starmer said Covid-19 had been a call to arms that now required a Beveridge-scale response from government. ,But is this simply political hyperbole or are we at a similar turning point? ,The pandemic has certainly been a shared upheaval and trauma unlike anything Britain has experienced since the war. ,Sir William Beveridge's 1942 report did not land without warning.,It had been commissioned by a government made up of Conservative and Labour ministers who were already thinking about reconstruction even as the fighting continued. ,The experience of war had amplified a debate about the condition of the country - its poverty, housing and health. ,But the 300-page report that Sir William, a Liberal retired civil servant, delivered that December was an immediate sensation. ,The dryly titled , report was densely technical but charged with moral purpose. Beveridge described slaying the ""five giants on the road to reconstruction"": Want, disease, idleness, ignorance and squalor. ,Implemented after the war by Labour, the report's recommendations laid the foundation of the modern welfare state and the NHS was also born. It was a short period of radical social reform without precedent. ,Does this feel a similar moment? A war and a pandemic are very different of course. And the UK today is a country Sir William Beveridge wouldn't recognise. ,Wealthier, more diverse and wired into a mobile, global economy. Many of the jobs people do are utterly different compared to the 1940s. ,But Beveridge would recognise the broad debates about poverty, insecure employment, the nation's health and inequality that have been magnified by Covid. ,A decade ago, the epidemiologist Professor Sir Michael Marmot wrote ,. He's recently produced another Beveridge-esque study called Build Back Fairer. ,He says of his review: ""Life expectancy had stopped improving. Inequalities in health were increasing and life expectancy for the poorest people outside London was going down. It means we were in terrible shape."" ,The pandemic has cruelly exposed the underlying vulnerabilities of UK's health. It has shone a harsh light on the state of the social care sector too.,Perhaps that is the issue a modern-day Beveridge might choose to tackle first - whoever that may be. ,Unlike the NHS, social care is not free at the point of use. ,The delivery of health and social care is devolved to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Each nation has developed their care systems in different ways. ,England awaits reform.,All recent governments have known an aging population requires complex care within a system that is properly and sustainably funded. But despite years of reports, a Royal Commission and a forest full of policy papers, the nettle has never been grasped. ,This government has promised proposals by the end of this year.,Indeed, at a Liaison Committee session on Wednesday, Boris Johnson said there will be proposals brought forward in the coming year.,""It is going to be difficult. There is no solution to social care which avoids real decision about who pays for what and how much we pay,"" says Rachel Wolf, who co-authored the Tories' 2019 manifesto. ,""My assumption is they will not only bring forward some kind of package around funding but also about how it's delivered. ,""Do we want to make it easier for there to be in-home social care for example? What is that we want the workforce to look like and how are we going to train and support them? Often with social care we get so caught up in the funding question we don't actually discuss any of the others,"" she told me.,The costs of social care can be catastrophic for people. Care is means-tested and unlike the NHS, the principle of pooled risk does not apply. ,But could the aftermath of the pandemic be the moment a cross-party consensus on the future of social care might be found? ,Recent history is not encouraging. ,Less politically controversial, but perhaps just as hard to tackle, are the inequalities in health exposed by coronavirus.  ,""Obesity and deprivation and poverty and the type of job you lead have all contributed to the increased death rate in this country from Covid-19,"" according to Dame Sally Davies, the former Chief Medical Officer for England.,She believes tackling obesity is an urgent priority (""we are the fatties of Europe,"" she says) and has called for an extension of the sugar levy and for private companies to contribute to a public health investment fund.,""I think post-Covid-19, the government has the mandate to do something different along the Beveridge lines. Beveridge got us to invest in a national illness service. We needed that then and still need it. But alongside that we need to invest in prevention."",The political historian Peter Hennessey believes the ""never again"" impulse that sprung from the war is evident now and could be harnessed to build consensus around five new priorities.,He has suggested: housing, technical education, tackling climate change, preparing the UK for the impact of artificial intelligence and, of course, reform of social care. Others will have their own ideas about what the UK might be galvanized to tackle.,Or perhaps, as the jabs rollout, the pubs reopen and families reunite, Britain will muddle its way back to business as usual with a sigh of relief.,Before the pandemic hit the post-Brexit (media) narrative was about a fractured country of conflicting values, outlooks and views. Is there really the popular kindling for a new consensus around radical social reform?,Compared with the figures who drove through the Beverage agenda are today's politicians too small to try and grapple modern giants?,Citing Sir William Beveridge and the era's reforming zeal is the easy part. Carrying the country into action may prove much harder. ",politics

An admittedly small sample of members of the Federation of Small Business found that one in four exporters had paused sales to the EU and 11% were considering abandoning exports to the bloc completely. ,Scott Clarke is a director at Rex London, a specialist gift company selling goods all over Europe. He described January as ""chaotic"". There were delays and confusion at customs, additional freight costs, and extra charges for his EU customers in the form of duties and taxes.  Many of his shipments weren't getting through at all and were returned to his warehouse in west London.,""We had hundreds of boxes we tried to send in January, and they all came back,"" says Scott.,""There was probably a three or four week period at the beginning of the year where we couldn't supply our customers at all, which is a big deal for us because over half of our business is with Europe."",He acknowledges that things have got better, but many of the difficulties they have faced are here to stay.,""It has calmed down a lot. We can supply our customers in Europe now. But we're three months in, and this doesn't seem sustainable in the longer term,"" he adds. ,""There's been a lot of talk about teething issues. There were teething issues, but they were just part of the underlying problems that haven't gone away."",What's the solution? For Scott, it's to establish a warehouse in Belgium so he can better serve his customers in Europe, without customs delays and extra costs. It's something they previously saw as a ""worst case scenario"" option, and he says there'll be negative consequences for the UK. ,""Splitting off part of our business and sending it to Belgium probably means that further growth is going to be happening there. Instead of taking on new staff here, we'll employ them there. Instead of making more profit and paying more tax here, we'll pay it there. Basically, everyone is losing out here,"" he says.,He's not the only one looking at establishing a base in the EU. The BBC has spoken to a number of investment agencies around Europe - including in Germany, Belgium, Austria and France. All of them say they've seen a big increase in the number of UK businesses expressing an interest in moving some of their operations across the channel. The Netherlands is emerging as a favourite destination. ,Michiel Bakhuizen is from the Netherlands Foreign investment Agency. They have been in talks with over 600 UK businesses since the Brexit referendum, and the monthly numbers have increased since the start of this year.,""In January, 40 companies made enquiries, in February it doubled to 80 companies, and up until the middle of March it was 40 again, so interest is really growing. The numbers have more than doubled on the average month in 2020,"" says Michiel.,""Interest has grown since January, because of the real difficulties Brexit is causing some companies in the UK. They're talking about administrative hurdles, supply chain related problems, licensing issues, so those problems are real and that's why those companies are showing interest in the Netherlands and other countries."",Michiel is keen to point out there are downsides for the Netherlands too.,""The Netherlands is not 'winning' this. If you look at Brexit from a macro perspective, the Netherlands just lost its second biggest trading partner, moving outside the European Union and the single market,"" he says. ,""Obviously attracting foreign business towards the Netherlands is growing because UK businesses need a future in the European market, and the Netherlands is there to help them to secure that, but in the end Brexit is not good news for the Netherlands."",For other exporters to the EU, shifting some of the business closer to their customers just isn't an option. ,Sarah Braithwaite's company, Forage Plus, specialises in nutritional products for horses, which have proved to be very popular with European customers in recent years. They're based in North Wales, but up until January, they were able to ship their goods to 20 European countries within a matter of days. Not anymore. One package she sent to Sweden in January still hasn't arrived, with customs officers there requesting additional documentation to clear it, from manufacturing flow charts to photos of individual products. But there are other issues too. ,""It's been frustrating, demoralising, upsetting. For a while we just thought it was a hold-up at customs, just the sheer volume of shipments and they couldn't cope. And then we realised we weren't going to be able to get our parcels into Europe without our customers paying quite big import duties,"" she says.,Rather than shipping to other businesses in Europe, Sarah sends her goods directly to customers, who have been faced with unexpected duties and taxes, as high as 40% of the original price, depending on which EU country it goes to. Together with customs delays, it's meant that orders have dried up, and she's had to refund thousands of pounds.,""For us, as a company shipping into Europe, a typical month would be around 160, 170, 180 orders into 18 to 20 different countries. Today, when I asked my staff how many we have into Europe, there are none. How many orders have we had this month? Two or three,"" she says.,""If a customer orders from Europe today, we can't actually get it to them. In some instances we can't get it to them at all, and in others, they're charged such a large amount of import duty that they're just not going to do that. We're going to lost that custom."",Sarah hasn't given up entirely and is trying to find ways to keep supplying her customers. A Dutch warehouse isn't on the cards though.,""It's unrealistic to say, set up some kind of European warehouse when you haven't got the finances or the manpower. We would have to employ new people. How are we going to employ new people when we've just lost £300,000 worth of business? It's just not realistic, it really isn't."",The government has set up a £20m Brexit Support Fund for small and medium-sized businesses and is also providing export helplines, and webinars with a network of 300 international trade experts.,This assistance has been welcomed and the Federation of Small Businesses has called for an increase in the size of the support fund.  ,But the provision of this support is perhaps a tacit acknowledgement on the part of the government that something that was once easy and cheap is now difficult and expensive. Given that the EU accounts for nearly half of all UK exports, that is a reality that cannot be good for the UK economy. ,Much-vaunted trade deals with countries including the US, Australia, New Zealand and others have not yet arrived and the government's own analysis said deals with all of them would add less than 1% to UK GDP in 15 years' time and fail to offset the hit to trade with the EU. ,The tariff-free trade with the EU that the Brexit deal secured is welcomed by business but tariffs are only a small part of the picture. What many businesses are discovering is that exporting requires time, investment and expertise. For decades, sending goods to Berlin was as easy as sending goods to Birmingham - as a member of a single market without trade borders or barriers, it wasn't really exporting at all. ,Michael Gove said he hoped the exporting expertise firms are acquiring (reluctantly in many cases) will make them ""match fit"" to grasp new opportunities beyond the EU. ,But back in west London, Scott says the last three months have highlighted the challenges businesses face in sending their goods anywhere around the world.,""One of the great irritations for me is the idea that we're going to suddenly be free to export more around the world. It's just not true. Exporting is really difficult. I think if anything, people will now know how difficult it is.""",politics

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-56583168,Scottish election 2021: Five things we learned from the first debate,"The Scottish Parliament term ended in a blaze of bad temper, with votes of no confidence and personal attacks flying thick and fast.,So this debate was a chance to see if the temperature would come down as parties hit the campaign trail - or escalate still further.,The leaders all called each other by their first names throughout, and with the audience dialling in from home sought not to shout over each other in the hush of a largely deserted studio - at least to start with.,But ultimately there are deep divisions between these politicians. And they showed.,It is still early days in the election campaign, but already the shapes of the platforms parties are building are becoming clear.,SNP leader and First Minister Nicola Sturgeon leaned on her pandemic leadership and the promise of a fresh choice on Scotland's future for the electorate - with a heavy caveat that any vote would come ,the health crisis has passed.,As in her campaign conference speech on Monday, Ms Sturgeon chose to single out her dream opponent in this debate - the prime minister.,On independence, her pitch is straightforward - who would you rather have in charge, me or Boris Johnson?,But it was another politician, not actually in the room, who was cited by Ms Sturgeon's opponents - Alex Salmond and his new Alba Party.,His intervention complicates the independence issue for Ms Sturgeon, in that he and his party present a different vision of her core policy and even different ways of achieving it - opening up all kinds of detailed, difficult questions that the SNP leader would rather keep for another day and campaign.,But ultimately the former first minister was not the ghost at the feast in this event - the leaders present managed to drag the debate back to independence time and again all on their own. ,Somehow, even what looked set to be a heart-warming segment at the end where all the leaders agreed to call out abusive language in political discourse ended with a row about the constitution.,Conservative leader Douglas Ross sought to galvanise his base by going back to the well of ""no referendum"" repeatedly. He mainly sought out clashes with Ms Sturgeon, given his party's goal is to deprive her party of a majority and provide ""strong opposition"" at Holyrood.,He may have actually overdone it somewhat when he said he wouldn't even work with the SNP to tackle climate change, such are their constitutional disagreements.,And independence was also his weapon of choice when attacking Anas Sarwar, seeking to tempt any hardcore unionists in the Labour ranks into backing his party instead.,Mr Sarwar, recently elected the leader of a party which has lost its position atop Scottish politics along with much of its traditional support to the SNP over recent years, has a more difficult tightrope to walk.,The primacy of the constitutional debate has left Labour looking rather shut out in campaigns since the 2014 referendum, with the SNP corralling pro-independence voters and the Conservatives cloaking themselves in the Union flag.,But the pandemic - along with Mr Sarwar's extremely-new-broom leadership - has added a fresh edge to their cry of ""wouldn't you rather talk about something else?"",Thus he sought to appear the reasonable alternative to both parties at every turn. If Labour has bled votes to both ends of the constitutional spectrum in the past, Mr Sarwar hopes to win them back from both ends now too.,Green co-leader Lorna Slater also had a tricky balancing act to perform, in her first appearance in a TV debate.,With the Alba Party providing extra competition for pro-independence votes, the Greens need to underline their credentials on that front - and she did so with another attack on the Westminster government.,However, they also need to differentiate themselves from the SNP, to give that party's supporters a reason to not just back them on both ballot papers. In the year the COP26 climate summit comes to Glasgow, the environment is as solid an electoral hook as anyone could wish for, and it's home turf for the Greens.,Meanwhile, Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie was one of the more experienced campaigners on the stage, and he harked back to previous campaigns by stressing that he didn't want to repeat them.,The Lib Dems have long traded off their pro-European image, and Mr Rennie used that to prop up his other constitutional argument by saying a new independence vote would be a re-run of Brexit.,In trademark Rennie style he also provided one of the few laughs of the evening when he was caught on camera waving back at audience members who were saying goodbye at the end of the programme.,This was an early-election contest, with parties happy for a chance to set the tone for the weeks ahead - but mostly seeking to avoid any serious gaffes.,In fact it's so early in the campaign that nobody has published a manifesto yet.,None of the leaders opted to use the debate to launch a shiny new policy, so ultimately they either had to stick to predictable, well-trodden ground, or drop some hints.,Nicola Sturgeon let slip that there might be something to come in the SNP manifesto about the universal basic income, an idea the party has backed trials of in the past.,But somehow the biggest row about a specific manifesto promise was one dating back to 2007 - the SNP's pledge to scrap the council tax, which sparked yet another confrontation between Mr Ross and Ms Sturgeon.,In the weeks ahead, more policy pledges and details should be forthcoming - providing plenty of fodder for the debates to come.",business

This number is then multiplied by 100,000.,Looking at the total number of cases by health board, the highest number has been in NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, reflecting the fact it is the most populous part of Scotland.,The coronavirus outbreak has created a huge load on Scotland's hospitals during both the first and second waves of the pandemic.,At the peak of the outbreak in the spring there were more than 1,500 Covid patients in hospital, including over 200 in intensive care wards.,Numbers reduced over the summer, but started to rise steadily again in September. In January 2021, the number of Covid patients in hospital passed the spring peak of 1,520.,Only patients who test positive during their current stay in hospital, or in the two weeks before their admission, are counted by the Scottish government as Covid-19 patients.,They are no longer classified as Covid patients after 28 days in hospital or 28 days after their positive test, whichever is later.,However, the Scottish government now publishes figures on Covid-19 patients who have been treated in intensive care for more than 28 days.,The World Health Organisation (WHO) says the percentage of positive test results is a key measure ,.,The organisation recommended in May that a country's positivity rate should be below 5% for at least two weeks before governments considered relaxing lockdown restrictions.,Other measures include a decline in Covid-related deaths and hospital admissions.,The Scottish government ,.,This chart shows the positivity rate in Scotland since 18 August.,The Scottish government ,.,Previously, the government calculated it by dividing the number of positive cases with the number of newly-tested individuals each day.,However, it now calculates the rate using the number of positive tests reported each day.,The Scottish government said it changed the method to bring it into line with the WHO's criteria, and because the previous measure was ""likely to over-estimate the positivity rate"" as more people were repeatedly tested.,The R number, or reproduction number, is a way of rating a disease's ability to spread.

AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould said:,""Deliveroo has gone from hero to zero as the much-hyped stock market debut falls flat on its face.,""Initially there was a lot of fanfare about the Amazon-backed company making its shares available to the public, including the ability for customers to buy stock. Sadly, the narrative took a turn for the worst when multiple fund managers came out and said they wouldn't back the business due to concerns about working practices."",Deliveroo, which has not yet made a profit, said on Monday it had chosen to ""price responsibly"" and sell its shares at the bottom of its planned price range at 390p due to ""volatile"" market conditions.,Some of the UK's biggest investment fund managers, including Aberdeen Standard, Aviva Investors, BMO Global, charity fund manager CCLA, Legal and General Investment Management and M&G said recently they would not buy shares in Deliveroo, citing concerns over including the working conditions of its riders and lack of investor power.,This was supposed to be a landmark day for Deliveroo, the wider UK tech sector and the London Stock Exchange. A British business founded just eight years ago had shown it could grow and prosper here without falling into overseas hands and by choosing London rather than New York for its stock market debut, setting an example for others to follow. ,But the sharp fall this morning in shares - already priced at the conservative end of the planned range - showed that faith in Deliveroo's prospects was somewhat shaky. It was as if investors had suddenly woken up to something which should have been obvious all along - Deliveroo might have grown rapidly during the pandemic but it is still racking up big losses in what is a competitive food delivery market, ,Then there's the question of whether the company might have to improve pay and conditions for its delivery drivers following Uber's defeat before the Supreme Court. However loudly Deliveroo insisted that the Uber ruling had no relevance to its business, some investors weren't so sure, worrying that the path to profitability might be even tougher. ,As the Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has said, pointing at Facebook, a shaky debut does not mean the shares won't soar in the longer term. Then again, Facebook didn't have to compete with Uber Eats and Just Eat in a market that looks a far more challenging place to make money than online advertising.,Founder Will Shu will have shares that give him 20-times the voting power of other investors.,Chief executive Will Shu said he was ""very proud"" that Deliveroo was listing in London.,""In this next phase of our journey as a public company we will continue to invest in the innovations that help restaurants and grocers to grow their businesses, to bring customers more choice than ever before, and to provide riders with more work,"" he added.,Deliveroo's self-employed drivers have seen a boom in demand during the Covid-19 pandemic, bringing food from restaurants to housebound customers.,Initially, Deliveroo hoped to see that value as high as £8.8bn, based on a share price of 390-460p. It scaled that back to £7.6bn, but the share price drop wiped £2.28bn off that.,The firm is making a portion of its stock available for customers, with delivery riders and restaurant partners also able to buy shares.,Deliveroo is selling just over one-fifth of the group, while institutional investing trading started on Wednesday, the general public can start trading in its shares from 7 April.,Private companies, as a way of raising cash, can start a process to list on a stock exchange.,In an initial public offering (IPO) companies offer shares to investors before listing.,The price of the shares is typically set by investment banks hired by the company to run the process.,But once the shares start to be publicly traded, prices are set by supply and demand.,The value of the shares, multiplied by how many there are, gives the market value of the company.,Sophie Lund-Yates, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the biggest concern from investors was about worker rights: ""The flexible employee model of Deliveroo's riders is a huge pillar of the group's plans for success.,""If forced to offer more traditional employee benefits, like company pension contributions, Deliveroo's already thin margins would struggle to climb, and the road to profitability would look very tough indeed."",She said it was difficult to value the firm as it had yet to turn a profit. ,Neil Wilson, chief market analyst for Markets.com, said that ""even pricing the initial public offering at the bottom of the range, Deliveroo was demanding too high a price tag for a loss-making delivery platform in a very competitive space with a questionable path to profitability.,""The books were covered, it was just plain mis-priced."",Please include a contact number if you are willing to speak to a BBC journalist.

AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould said:,""Deliveroo has gone from hero to zero as the much-hyped stock market debut falls flat on its face.,""Initially there was a lot of fanfare about the Amazon-backed company making its shares available to the public, including the ability for customers to buy stock. Sadly, the narrative took a turn for the worst when multiple fund managers came out and said they wouldn't back the business due to concerns about working practices."",Deliveroo, which has not yet made a profit, said on Monday it had chosen to ""price responsibly"" and sell its shares at the bottom of its planned price range at 390p due to ""volatile"" market conditions.,Some of the UK's biggest investment fund managers, including Aberdeen Standard, Aviva Investors, BMO Global, charity fund manager CCLA, Legal and General Investment Management and M&G said recently they would not buy shares in Deliveroo, citing concerns over including the working conditions of its riders and lack of investor power.,This was supposed to be a landmark day for Deliveroo, the wider UK tech sector and the London Stock Exchange. A British business founded just eight years ago had shown it could grow and prosper here without falling into overseas hands and by choosing London rather than New York for its stock market debut, setting an example for others to follow. ,But the sharp fall this morning in shares - already priced at the conservative end of the planned range - showed that faith in Deliveroo's prospects was somewhat shaky. It was as if investors had suddenly woken up to something which should have been obvious all along - Deliveroo might have grown rapidly during the pandemic but it is still racking up big losses in what is a competitive food delivery market, ,Then there's the question of whether the company might have to improve pay and conditions for its delivery drivers following Uber's defeat before the Supreme Court. However loudly Deliveroo insisted that the Uber ruling had no relevance to its business, some investors weren't so sure, worrying that the path to profitability might be even tougher. ,As the Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has said, pointing at Facebook, a shaky debut does not mean the shares won't soar in the longer term. Then again, Facebook didn't have to compete with Uber Eats and Just Eat in a market that looks a far more challenging place to make money than online advertising.,Founder Will Shu will have shares that give him 20-times the voting power of other investors.,Chief executive Will Shu said he was ""very proud"" that Deliveroo was listing in London.,""In this next phase of our journey as a public company we will continue to invest in the innovations that help restaurants and grocers to grow their businesses, to bring customers more choice than ever before, and to provide riders with more work,"" he added.,Deliveroo's self-employed drivers have seen a boom in demand during the Covid-19 pandemic, bringing food from restaurants to housebound customers.,Initially, Deliveroo hoped to see that value as high as £8.8bn, based on a share price of 390-460p. It scaled that back to £7.6bn, but the share price drop wiped £2.28bn off that.,The firm is making a portion of its stock available for customers, with delivery riders and restaurant partners also able to buy shares.,Deliveroo is selling just over one-fifth of the group, while institutional investing trading started on Wednesday, the general public can start trading in its shares from 7 April.,Private companies, as a way of raising cash, can start a process to list on a stock exchange.,In an initial public offering (IPO) companies offer shares to investors before listing.,The price of the shares is typically set by investment banks hired by the company to run the process.,But once the shares start to be publicly traded, prices are set by supply and demand.,The value of the shares, multiplied by how many there are, gives the market value of the company.,Sophie Lund-Yates, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the biggest concern from investors was about worker rights: ""The flexible employee model of Deliveroo's riders is a huge pillar of the group's plans for success.,""If forced to offer more traditional employee benefits, like company pension contributions, Deliveroo's already thin margins would struggle to climb, and the road to profitability would look very tough indeed."",She said it was difficult to value the firm as it had yet to turn a profit. ,Neil Wilson, chief market analyst for Markets.com, said that ""even pricing the initial public offering at the bottom of the range, Deliveroo was demanding too high a price tag for a loss-making delivery platform in a very competitive space with a questionable path to profitability.,""The books were covered, it was just plain mis-priced."",Please include a contact number if you are willing to speak to a BBC journalist.

https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56344609,How bees and drones team up to find landmines,"Thanks to the fact that they can pick up the scent of explosives with their antennae, researchers in countries such as Croatia have spent years perfecting how to use bees as landmine locators.,But there's a problem. As the insects whizz merrily about a mine-contaminated area, it's extremely difficult for humans to keep track of where they go, not least because chasing bees across a minefield is not a great idea.,That's where the drones come in. A team from Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia have come up with a way of using drones to monitor the bees while they work. The unmanned aerial vehicles fly around, capturing footage of the insects, which is later analysed by computers to reveal where landmines may be hidden in the ground.,Landmines buried during wars that happened decades ago continue to present a deadly threat in many parts of the world. Many thousands were planted during the Balkans war of the 1990s and many persist today., in Bosnia and Herzegovina and ,. Clearing the devices is seen as a long-term, arduous project with no easy solutions. But technological innovations could still make a difference.,""We wanted to try to exclude humans from potential danger… and try to use drones,"" says Vladimir Risojević from the University of Banja Luka in Bosnia and Herzegovina.,Previously, another team of fellow researchers , in landmine detection. They achieved this by getting the bees to associate the smell of TNT with food - a sugar solution.,In the field, the trained bees tend to cluster near to places where mines are buried, in the hope of finding food.,Such efforts have been active for many years but Prof Risojević says he and his team realised that computers could help by automatically analysing footage of the mine-seeking bees, in order to plot their activity and more easily locate the mines.,Even this proved tricky.,""It's very difficult for human observers to find these flying bees in this video footage let alone computer vision systems,"" he says.,""There were moments when I thought that we are outright crazy for trying to do that but I am pleasantly surprised with the results that we obtained."",The team began with drone-captured footage of an outdoor area, onto which they superimposed ""synthetic bees"" - fuzzy grey blobs zooming about the scene. ,When they managed to get the synthetic bees to look indistinguishable from footage of real bees, the team turned to a machine-learning algorithm, and trained it to accurately detect and follow the blobs on screen.,In tests ,, the algorithm proved more than 80% accurate at tracking these digital bees. ,The researchers then took to a minefield, a safe one with real but defused mines buried in undisclosed locations at the Croatia Mine Action Center, to see how the system performed under authentic conditions.,Details of the test results are yet to be published in an academic paper but Prof Risojević says there was a strong correlation between where the bees clustered and the locations of known mines at the test site. ,At the moment, the system works by using drones programmed to fly along a predetermined route, criss-crossing the minefield while capturing footage of the bees as they buzz around. Analysis of the footage later reveals where the bees clustered. ,It may be a few years before this approach is used in a place blighted with dangerous, active mines, says Prof Risojević. However, he thinks it could complement other demining techniques. Among the technological tools already used for demining are , with built-in ground-penetrating radar.,Even with the help of technology like that, it's hard for demining teams to know for sure that they have removed every single mine from a contaminated area. The bees and drones could check afterwards, for example, to confirm that none have been missed.,""Good technological innovation that can help to… delineate the boundaries and confirm a hazard area are really helpful,"" says Matthew Breay Bolton at Pace University in New York, author of Political Minefields: The Struggle against Automated Killing.,However, he adds that there are no quick fixes to the minefield problem. Often, political wrangling and lack of resources mean clearance projects can stall, no matter what technologies are available to help. Plus, in countries such as Yemen, ,.,Prof Risojević is hopeful that, despite the hurdles, his team's system will one day help to decontaminate minefields in countries such as Croatia or Bosnia and Herzegovina. ,And there may be other applications too.,In recent years, computer vision researchers have developed experimental systems able to ,. Prof Risojević and his team suggest that such tools could one day monitor pollinators. These insects, including bees, are crucial to the health of crops and ecosystems but their numbers have been declining lately, largely due to pollution caused by human activities. ,Insects and machines working together - a fun idea, and potentially good for the planet.",business

While 35% of such organisations say they have seen a decrease in the number of people volunteering over the past year, 20% saw a rise, and 45% no change, , (National Council for Voluntary Organisations).,This has come at the same time as the NCVO said there was more demand on charities' services, and several other studies say ,So how can charities both engage more volunteers, and raise more funds to meet the continuing increase in need for their services? A number of tech firms believe they can help.,Deedmob, an Amsterdam-based small firm, says the way to get more young adults volunteering is simply to make it easier for them to do so.,Founded in 2016 by three student friends, its website and app matches people's skills and interests with volunteering tasks and causes, and allows them to volunteer for short periods of time rather than have to make long-term commitments.,""A lot of people want to do some volunteering next to their job, or while they study, but before they couldn't find the right opportunities at the right time,"" says Deedmob co-founder and chief executive Boudewijn Wijnands.,Ms Smissaert has done voluntary work for the past seven years, everything from helping people find jobs, to assisting newly settled refugees, and the more recent delivering food shopping.

https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56495443,I have learned how to survive with a bow and arrow',"It's past midnight deep in a Florida wetland, and I'm riding in a ridiculously beefed-up Jeep with a loaded rifle and a $12,000 (£8,700) thermal night-vision scope in my lap.,The muddy water is so deep that it occasionally spills over into the windowless vehicle, as I scan around my seat nervously for alligators. Simultaneously, I'm trying to follow a conversation between two scraggly men speaking a dialect of English that I can barely understand.,The story of how someone like me, who only a year ago would've been far more likely to be in a yoga class in Brooklyn, is hunting for wild hogs with a bunch of self-identifying hillbillies is a complicated one. Yet strangely enough, I'm far from alone.,Like some , I bought a firearm for the first time. I walked into a gun store, which was also an entirely new thing for me to do, and purchased a bolt-action Winchester 30.06 hunting rifle.,The decision was driven as much by fears over social unrest as concern that the food supply chain might break down due to the pandemic.,While I would in no way call myself a ""prepper"" or doomsday cultist, the sight of violent clashes on the streets last summer, and empty shelves at grocery stores, was enough to inspire me to buy a gun for safety, and learn how to use it to procure food in the wild.,After panic buying caused severe ammunition shortages across the country, I then went a step further, learning to track and hunt game with a bow and arrow, and process meat in the field. ,Over the past few months, I've been set upon by a snarling coyote that only stopped once I pointed a gun at its face from 10ft (three metres) away, and forged an unlikely friendship with a hunting and survival mentor from Pennsylvania. He's been shot in the back by poachers, and attacked by bears.,Not long ago, if someone told me they were learning to survive in the woods with a bow and arrow in case of social collapse in the US, I would've thought they were unhinged. But further statistics suggest an increasing number of people are taking those concerns seriously. ,Last year, the state of Michigan reported , Many of those people came from outside traditional hunting demographics - a shift that's been reflected throughout the US. ,Dave Marks is one of them. A doctor in the uber-liberal college town of Chapel Hill, North Carolina, he walked into a gun store at the start of the pandemic and bought one of the last shotguns on the shelf.,Within a few months, he was hunting - something that didn't sit very well with his wife, an ""anti-gun, anti-hunting vegan"", or their vegetarian children.  ""I was raised by New York Jews,"" says Mr Marks. ""No one hunted in my family. No one had guns. Hunting always seemed ethically questionable to me, something that mostly rednecks do."",Despite his wife's dismay, he taught himself to hunt with guns and crossbows, learned how to field dress deer, and even purchased hunting land. While he says the possibility of the food supply chain breaking down was part of the consideration, he's more interested in ethical meat harvesting and wildlife conservation.,A self-described ""moderate liberal,"" he also found himself making peace with the conservatism of rural America at a time when those two sides of the US were seemingly not on speaking terms with one another. ""It makes you appreciate the commonalities, the things that you can relate to with people from different backgrounds and political views,"" he says.,The hope within the hunting community is that the new enthusiasts like Mr Marks will help reinvigorate a pastime that had been in sharp decline.,In 2016 there were 11.5 million hunters in the US, ,This was down from 13.7 million in 2011, and the more than 17 million back in the 1980s.,Reasons for the fall range from the increased popularity of vegetarian or vegan diets, to public shaming of hunters, and fewer young people taking up the hobby.,These declines in hunting numbers were welcome news to some animal rights advocates, and we have to respect their viewpoint.,People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta), the world's largest animal rights organization, says that hunting is an ""unnecessary, violent form of 'entertainment' [that] rips animal families apart"". Anyone interested ,However, state wildlife agencies get about 60% of their budget from the sale of hunting licenses, and taxes on guns and ammunition.,They also rely heavily on hunters to control animal populations that have made extraordinary comebacks since managed wildlife programs began in the early 20th century. In 1930, for example, there were only 300,000 white tail deer left in the US. Today, ,There are also increasing efforts to make the US hunting community less white, and less male. Website Outdoor Life estimated in 2019 ,Opportunity Outdoors is a volunteer organization based in North Carolina whose mission is to bring new people into hunting by making it more inclusive and accessible.,Founded in 2019 by young hunters Andy Tomaszewski and Evan Trebilcock, their intention was to create a scalable mentorship program that could be rolled out nationally over the next few years. The group promotes ethical hunting combined with conservation and outdoor survival skills such as wild foraging. ,Their outreach coordinator, 23-year-old Safiyyah Motaib, grew up in Queens, New York. She's also a practicing Muslim of Moroccan descent who performs her daily prayers while out in the field. And she hunts according to Islam's Halal slaughter rules, whispering prayers before firing upon an animal.,""As a kid growing up in New York, I fantasized about the outdoors,"" says Ms Motaib, who is a research biochemist. ""I've always wanted to buy a hunting rifle. Covid pushed me to do that sooner, and it gave me the time to go out and start hunting.,""As far as the food supply system breaking down, I definitely think it's possible in a bigger crisis. So I think it's good to know how to hunt, and get your own food and preserve it properly.""  , is a new series exploring how businesses, trade, economies and working life are changing fast.,Meanwhile, far across the country in the remote desert canyons of Utah, Boulder Outdoor Survival School master instructor Jeremy Thomas reports that enrolment is up five-fold since 2019.,The program was created back in 1968, and is considered one of the toughest hunting and survival camps in the world. Students from across the US and around the world hike out into the desert for up to 28 days, carrying next to nothing, making their own fires, catching their own food, and drinking rainwater.   ,Mr Thomas believes the surge in interest since Covid-19 is two-fold.

According to salary comparison website PayScale, the average developer salary is around $74,000 (£53,000; €62,000).,Carl Mungazi studied journalism at university, and worked as a local journalist in Luton for four years before making the switch to developer in 2016.,His route into coding initially came from his desire to build a news aggregator for the local area, something he'd seen national publications build.,""I wanted to basically find a way of being able to track the news being published in Luton,"" Carl says.,A developer friend helped him build the back end - the technology behind the scenes holding everything together - and Carl taught himself to use Javascript - a programming language popular for building websites.,It also helped kick-start a career change when the journalism project eventually fizzled out.,Choosing which computer language to learn really depends on what you want to do.,Python is a powerful, general purpose language and is often the first language taught to undergraduates on computer science courses. ,It is widely used in business - YouTube, for example, is largely written in Python.,Ruby is another versatile language, popular with start-ups.,Whichever language a budding programmer opts for, there are vast resources online to support those teaching themselves. In his case, Carl says freecodecamp.org was particularly helpful.,Attending a boot camp is another popular option for career changers. Many of these have sprung up in recent years, offering intensive courses designed to equip participants with the skills needed to get that crucial first job.,Brenden Thornton chose this route, enrolling on a course offered by boot camp Flatiron School, whilst shifting careers away from being an National Basketball Association (NBA) cameraman.,""One big advantage of going to a boot camp is having a set curriculum planned out for you. I didn't have to do any guesswork when it came to deciding what technologies to learn and how I was going to teach them to myself,"" he explains.,The support that comes with attending such boot camps was also key in his decision.,""They really take the time to build a solid support team around you, not only through job opportunities, but also through career coaches who help you navigate the job search process."",One drawback of boot camps is that they can demand a lot of time and, for many, be prohibitively expensive. Many courses exceed $10,000.,A partial scholarship helped ease some of the financial burden for Brenden, but he still had a gruelling schedule.,During the boot camp his Monday to Friday routine involved getting up at 05:00 to drive for Uber and Lyft until 09:00. He would eat and study until 16:00 and then drive again until 21:00.,Regardless of the path taken into coding, ensuring that so-called softer skills are not neglected is essential.,""The skills that employers look for often are more than just the technologies,"" according to Barry Cranford, managing director of recruitment firm RecWorks.,""The main thing that really makes a difference is whether they can do it as part of a team."",For Hannah Blair, attending hackathons at university were a useful way to improve these transferable skills, as well as connect with others.,""Even if you're not heavily involved in the development of the product itself that you pitch at the end, there are just so many skills that you can take away,"" she says.,Having a public profile to highlight your work can also help when applying for roles.,Online platform Github is particularly popular among employers. ""It's like a portfolio for photography, you can dip into it and see what people have done,"" says Barry Cranford.,Finding a mentor to support you is another area that can provide a boost, he says, and could be a ""secret weapon"" for your career.,As with many industries, networking can also help build those first crucial contacts. ,""Attending any meet-ups can greatly increase your odds of landing a job,"" Brenden Thornton says. ""Network, network, network."",The challenges of getting that first job are not to be underestimated, however, particularly for career changers.,For Carl Mungazi it took 14 months to land his first role, as he came up against a problem familiar to many jobseekers. ,""One of the interviewers said to me that I had promise but they wanted me to get more experience."",Ultimately, whatever path taken into the industry, demonstrating a clear interest and passion for coding and programming must shine through.,""It's a very challenging process that will really push your mental toughness, but if you're able to push through then it will seriously change your life,"" says Brenden.",business

https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56590001,Huawei’s business damaged by US sanctions despite success at home,"The US took action amid claims that the company posed a security risk and last July, the UK said it would exclude the company from building its 5G network.,Growth elsewhere in the company meant that it did make a profit overall.,But chairman Ken Hu, referring to the impact of the sanctions, told the BBC: ""It has caused a lot of damage to us."" ,Mr Hu, speaking at the launch of Huawei's 2020 report, called for a review of the global supply chain of critical technology.,Huawei has also tried to explain more about its ownership structure arguing that it will not allow interference from the Chinese state.,Mr Hu described 2020 as a year of challenges, with a significant hit to the mobile phone business and slowing revenue growth. ,""Life was not easy for us,"" he said. ,Strength in other sectors and in the Chinese market meant overall revenue was up 3.8% at $136.7bn (£99.3bn) and profits up by 3.2% at $9.9bn.,Mr Hu said restrictions had hurt US suppliers and global consumers as well as Huawei. ""We think this is a very unfair situation,"" he told the BBC at a press conference.,In response, the company has stockpiled chips, invested in research and development, and diversified its supplies. ,It has also reportedly been developing its own chip production within China. Building domestic capacity for the most-advanced chips is currently a high priority for China. ,There is currently a worldwide shortage of chips, and Mr Hu called for a ""rethinking"" and a ""review"" of the globalised semi-conductor supply chain.,US authorities have argued that using Huawei's 5G equipment opens up countries to the possibilities of data being accessed by the Chinese state, or becoming vulnerable to being switched off.,Huawei has defended its independence from the Chinese state by trying to explain its unusual model of ownership. ,Jiang Xisheng, chief secretary of the board at Huawei, told the BBC that its employee-shareholders ""will not allow external interference into the company's operations"".,The company gave the BBC a remote video tour of the vault where more than 30 large cabinets contain records of the employees who own shares, listing when each individual bought them and for how much. ,Critics have said the system is opaque, and is more of a profit-sharing scheme than a mechanism of real control.,Mr Jiang compared the model to the partnership model of UK department store John Lewis, arguing it means the interests of employees are closely bound up with those of the company and it shares in its success.,Technically there are two owners of Huawei's holding company - its founder Ren Zhengfei, who owns 0.9%, and a trade union body which owns the rest.,The company says the union is the platform for the more than 121,000 employees who own shares. These are not like normal shares, however. Non-Chinese staff are not allowed to own them and the shares cannot be publicly traded or kept when someone leaves.,Holding a share offers a chance to vote for the representative commission which is technically the highest authority in the company. Candidates come from within different sectors of the company, and staff can watch a recorded presentation before voting. ,The process, Mr Jiang says, is competitive, although not as much as the US general election, he said when asked to compare it. ,This commission selects the board of directors which report to it every year. Its reports have always been approved.,Mr Ren retains a veto over key issues, including candidates for the board of directors and a supervisory board. The model for this, Mr Jiang explains, is partly that of the British constitutional monarch. He says the veto is designed to be a ""deterrent and constraint"" rather than to be regularly exercised.,Mr Jiang joined the company in 1989, two years after it was founded, when it consisted of only about 40 staff.,He says the employee-ownership model came about to bring in capital as well as to attract and retain staff, and has allowed Huawei to focus on long-term research and development.,To try to emphasise the company's openness, Mr Jiang picked up his phone during the interview to explain that all employees have an app on which they can post comments and ideas. He says that before our interview, he had seen one post that criticised him. ,Half of the 70 replies had backed the criticism and half had defended him, he said.,External critics, especially in the US, have argued that the representation committee is no more than a rubber-stamp and real power lies elsewhere, leaving the way open for hidden direction from the state. ,That is an idea Mr Jiang seeks to dispel. ,""For sure, we can say no to the state,"" he told the BBC. ""Even if some individual government officials wanted to intervene in our company's operations we have the right to say no to that."" ",business
https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56582568,Retailers call for 'Shop Out to Help Out' scheme when stores reopen,"They want the chancellor to offer a ""Shop Out to Help Out"" scheme to get consumers spending again when non-essential shops reopen on 12 April.,It would cover 50% of a shopper's costs, up to £10, on Monday to Wednesdays for a month. ,And it would only apply at physical stores with fewer than 10 staff. ,The ""Save The Street"" campaign says independent retailers won't survive without it. The Treasury did not comment on whether it would pursue the idea, but said it had protected ""millions"" of retail jobs during the pandemic.,The proposed scheme - which would work like the Eat Out to Help Out restaurant discounts last year - is backed by the likes of beauty entrepreneur Charlotte Tilbury, fashion designer Henry Holland and retail consultant Mary Portas. ,""We would be kidding ourselves to think that everything will be fine for independent retailers once they reopen on 12 April,"" says Ross Bailey, the entrepreneur leading the campaign.,""Now it is the government's responsibility to support these businesses and ensure they are given a fighting chance to bounce back - the government needs to show that all businesses matter, not just big businesses."",The British Retail Consortium estimates that non-essential retail stores lost around £22bn in sales in 2020 due to lockdown measures, as footfall declined by 40%.,Independent shops - many of which lack a strong online presence - were hit particularly hard as they faced prolonged closures and restrictions. ,Yet this hasn't stopped people from trying to start businesses. Latest data from Cornerstone Tax, which gives advice on property stamp duty, shows 13% of consumers have started, or intend to start, their own business in 2021.,The firm's research also shows more than half of consumers want to support smaller firms over retail giants. ,Clare Oakey is the co-founder of Frippery Lifestyle Boutique, an independent fashion and homeware retailer in Colchester. ,She and her business partner Kim will spend up to £1,000 on reopening promotional activities, including printing a hundred 10%-off discount vouchers for the local barber to give away, putting flower arrangements and sweets in the shop, and offering customers who make a purchase goodie bags.,Ms Oakey says that five retail chain outlets on the same high street will not be reopening on 12 April, along with a number of independent stores. So even though people in Colchester generally like supporting small retailers, more needs to be done to get the public spending on the High Street again.,""We've prioritised keeping our business open by paying invoices to suppliers to keep the company running long term, but the honest truth is that it's been financially tough on a very personal level for me and my business partner,"" Clare tells the BBC.,""We really badly need the support - any form of help to let us catch up and break even, in terms of a scheme that incentivises the customers. We're nothing without customers."",The only nice thing, she says, is that local independent businesses have come together to help each other out.  ,For example, while the Frippery has been closed in the most recent lockdown, a nearby artisan coffee shop, Sir Isaacs Coffee House, has offered a click-and-collect service on its behalf. ,It meant the Frippery could continue serving its customers online, while the coffee shop got more exposure and hopefully sold a few extra coffees.,Retail analysts are also seriously concerned about the situation facing Britain's independent shops.,""Independent retailers have had a tumultuous year and immediate action is needed to avoid a high street apocalypse,"" says Natalie Berg, retail analyst at NBK Retail.,A Shop Out to Help Out Scheme would encourage consumers to ""ditch their screens"" and support their local shops, she says.,""This is a unique opportunity to redefine our high streets, but without government support we'll be bracing for a retail bloodbath."",Retail expert Kate Hardcastle agrees, pointing out that independent retailers were the ones who ""really demonstrated their worth"" in the early days of the pandemic in coming to their communities' aid when other retailers didn't have their online shopping offerings ready.,She is concerned that everyone will forget about them now.,""Just telling people to shop small as has been previous campaigns might serve as a reminder, not an action,"" she tells the BBC.,""Just as the case was with Eat Out to Help Out, we need to see our government support small businesses longer term.,""I'd love to see initiatives to make it easier for small businesses to open up on the High Street and rejuvenate."",She says the collaborative approach used by the Frippery and its neighbours is the right one: ""The future of small businesses has to be one of collaboration and not feeling they have to justify their worth to consumers all the time, but being able to focus on a brilliant offer because they can afford to survive."",A Treasury spokesman said: ""We've supported retailers across the UK though out the outbreak, protecting millions of jobs - and will continue to do so in the months ahead. ,""Shops won't pay any business rates until July, can continue to furlough staff until September, and are receiving Restart Grants of up to £6,000.""",business

https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56570364,AstraZeneca vaccine - was it really worth it?,"That was the view from one of the biggest institutional investors in the UK. ,It's not a view the pharmaceutical giant and its talismanic boss Pascal Soriot would have expected to hear, having developed a safe, effective vaccine at breakneck speed, signing contracts to deliver nearly two billion doses and doing it all without making a profit. ,Mr Soriot could be forgiven perhaps for thinking he would be getting a medal.,Instead he is getting brickbats from EU politicians like Belgian MEP Philippe Lamberts, who has accused the company of dishonesty and arrogance, in the way he alleges, it has ""over-promised and under-delivered"". ,Some are suggesting that the whole endeavour has been more trouble than it is worth. ,AstraZeneca has foregone over $20bn (£14.5bn) in revenue, while becoming a household name in the EU and the US for all the wrong reasons. ,Some investors have even questioned Pascal Soriot's position as chief executive. ,Astra has become a political football in a European blame game. ,One minute his compatriot, the French President Emmanuel Macron, is describing the vaccine as ""quasi-ineffective"", and the next, President Macron is volunteering to have the jab himself and backing a move to block exports outside the EU. ,Oxford University's Sir John Bell said Mr Soriot was mystified by the French approach: ""He's found dealing with the French one of the most difficult things he's had to do, because they have been so completely irrational."",There was also widespread anti-Astra outrage when a raid on an Italian pharmaceutical plant discovered a stash of nearly 30 million vaccines - only for it to dissipate when the company said that 16 million of them were for EU use and the rest were headed for poorer countries under an EU-backed program called Covid-19 Vaccines Global Access (Covax). ,In the US, Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), accused AstraZeneca of ""unforced errors"", in failing to include the most recent data in its trial submissions to US authorities. ,Even insiders admit: ""It's fair to say we are in a pretty uncomfortable spot right now."",As one investor told the BBC, ""[Pascal Soriot is] discovering what happens when you are doing politics, rather than business"". ,The story of AstraZeneca's adventures in vaccines and politics is impossible to separate from the background of the man in charge. ,As one of his competitors put it: ""Astra is Pascal's company, it's hard to tell where Pascal Soriot ends and AstraZeneca starts."" ,That is pretty unusual for a public company owned by huge institutional investors around the world.,Although he took over in 2012, Mr Soriot's dominant and hitherto unassailable position stemmed from his successful defence of the company from a $100bn takeover bid from American drug giant Pfizer in 2014. ,""When he took over, Astra was in a bit of a mess and he took some big risks investing in more R&D - so when Pfizer came along he felt vindicated,"" said one insider.,""He thought if Pfizer wanted to buy it, I must be on the right track"".  ,Mr Soriot used every defence trick in the book, including playing the British heritage card. Britain would be losing decades of science leadership historically and into the future. ,He styled himself as the bringer of cures, rather than corporate cost savings. ,The politicians of the day loved him for it - Sir Vince Cable, then-Business Secretary in David Cameron's Conservative Lib Dem coalition government remembers: ""Despite the fact the takeover would have put extra money in shareholders' pockets short-term, he and his directors stuck to their guns. ,""They took the view that it was a long-term project and they've been absolutely and completely vindicated and it's become a major national asset."",This episode cemented the affection of his staff, the respect and thanks of UK politicians, as well as an unshakeable personal self-belief. That last one can sometime be a double edged sword for any boss. ,AstraZeneca does not and has never had much experience with vaccines. Their strength is in treating cancer. ,So when Covid hit, AstraZeneca  was not necessarily the company many thought would lead the charge. ,There was talk of a tie-up between Oxford University and US pharmaceutical giant Merck, but the UK government was keen that Oxford should partner with a UK firm to establish a strong vaccine capability within the UK. ,It made sense for AstraZeneca as Oxford University had done a lot of the heavy research lifting - much of it funded by the UK government. ,When the initial results came in, there was an atmosphere of euphoria. Astra and Oxford would help save the world with a safe, effective and cheap vaccine, supplied at cost to the world. ,It doesn't get more pro-bono than that. This was arguably the high point. ,Since then, AstraZeneca has had a fraught relationship with regulators and politicians; its name has been unfairly but undoubtedly caught up in recriminations over a slow vaccine rollout in the EU; and the share price is 20% lower than it was last summer when the news flow seemed so positive. ,The problem is that manufacturing vaccines is really difficult. ""It's a bit like brewing beer,"" said an insider. ,""Some batches work better than others, and when you add in the complexity of regional supply chains, things get complicated and sometimes don't work."",So, if that's the case, is it not naïve at best and misleading at worst, to promise to deliver a fixed quantity of a potentially life or death product?,The insider added: ""We signed a contract on a best efforts' basis and we used our best efforts."",This is where Astra's lack of experience in vaccines really tripped it up - managing expectations through simple and effective communication. ,From the start, its efficacy numbers were hard to grasp, with separate numbers for different age groups. ,Questions were asked over sample sizes in over 65s and efficacy numbers submitted to US regulators had to be revised down when more up-to-date results were included. ,None of these made much of a difference to the overall picture - one of a safe and effective vaccine - but it fostered an impression the company was not being entirely competent, or entirely honest.,One source told the BBC that ""if you looked on an organisational chart of AstraZeneca, the box labelled vaccine management wouldn't have much in it"".,The company has already said it will review the status of its ""not-for-profit"" stance on its vaccine work when current contracts have been fulfilled. ,But Sir John says he can't blame the firm, ""given the way they have been treated"". ,A major investor suggested that when the contracts are fulfilled, this could be a moment the management review whether they want to be in the business at all. ,""Maybe that's the time to offer up the patent and move on,"" the investor said. The company says this is not their current thinking.,Trying to save the world has taken up a lot of the management's time and energy, at a time when the pharmaceutical giant is in the process of buying a US company for $40bn and a Japanese firm for $7bn. ,That would be enough of a to-do list for any chief executive under normal circumstances. ,But any thought that this vaccine mission could be both Mr Soriot's legacy and his epitaph seems very premature. ,One big investor pointed out that Mr Soriot will earn a lot of ""brownie points"" for taking on something so ambitious and delivering a vaccine that works. ,""He gets extra brownie points on the Environment Social and Governance (ESG) scorecard and he is still the person who turned around a company that was a mess when he took over,"" said the investor.,""I don't sense knives are being sharpened for him yet."",The lasting legacy of this French businessman may end up being making AstraZeneca a household name of which the UK, at least, seems genuinely proud.

It is currently carrying 18,300 containers.,The ship is operated by Taiwanese transport company Evergreen Marine and is one of the world's largest container vessels.,It became stranded on Tuesday, after running aground and becoming lodged sideways across the waterway. At first ,. ,The wind speed at the time was recorded at 40 knots, but the Suez Canal Authority (SCA) told reporters that this was not the only reason for the ship becoming stranded.,An investigation would be needed to determine whether technical or human errors occurred, the authority added. ,As of Sunday, there were 369 ships stuck in a tailback waiting to pass through the 193km (120-mile) canal on either side of the blockage.,Meanwhile, there have been more than 145,200 social interactions on Twitter using the  , hashtag and at least 133,000 shares, according to real-time analysis by brand monitoring platform BrandMentions. ,Over the weekend, 14 tugboats pulled and pushed the Ever Given at high tide to try to dislodge it and were able to move the ship ""30 degrees from left and right"".,​Then on Monday morning, after several reports that the ship had been partially refloated, the Suez Canal Authority (SCA) issued a statement saying that the Ever Given had been ""successfully refloated"".,The SCA said it would resume manoeuvres later on Monday high tide, ""allowing for the full restoration of the vessel's direction so it is positioned in the middle of the navigable waterway"".,Then at 13:05 GMT the Ever Given was finally fully freed.,However, it could take a while to clear the backlog of ships waiting to use the canal.,Richard Mead, managing editor of shipping journal Lloyd's List, told the BBC's Today Programme:  ""We're looking at about 450 ships still waiting to transit the canal. It's going to be a lengthy process clearing that backlog."",About 12% of global trade, around one million barrels of oil and roughly 8% of liquefied natural gas pass through the canal each day.,SCA chairman Osama Rabie on Saturday that the Canal's revenues were taking a $14m-$15m (£10.2m-£10.9m) hit for each day of the blockage.,Prior to the pandemic, trade passing through the Suez Canal contributed to 2% of Egypt's GDP, according to Moody's.,Separately, data from Lloyd's List showed the stranded ship was , along the waterway each day. That equates to $400m and 3.3 million tonnes of cargo an hour, or  $6.7m a minute.,Looking at the bigger picture, German insurer Allianz said on Friday its analysis showed the blockage could cost global trade between $6bn to $10bn a week and reduce annual trade growth by 0.2 to 0.4 percentage points.,Shipping broker Braemar ACM told the , that the cost of renting some vessels to ship cargo to and from Asia and the Middle East had jumped 47% to $2.2m. ,Some vessels have been rerouted to avoid the Suez Canal.

https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56564717,Credit Suisse and Nomura warn of hedge fund hit to profits,"Switzerland's second-biggest bank Credit Suisse said it could have a ""highly significant"" impact on its next quarterly results.,Japan's Nomura said it could make a $2bn (£1.4bn) loss from a US client.,Both have been hit by problems at hedge fund Archegos, which led to the sale of billions of pounds of shares on Friday.,Hedge funds make money buying and selling shares. It is thought that Archegos made some large investments in certain companies that started to go wrong, and its backers then insisted it raise money in a hurry, in what is known as a margin call, prompting some unusually large share sales.,A margin call is when a bank asks a client to put up more funds if a trade partly funded with borrowed money has dropped steeply. ,If they can't afford to do that, the lender will sell the shares to try to recover what it is owed.,Companies caught up in the selling spree include big names such as ViacomCBS, Discovery, Tencent, Baidu, and UK online retailer Farfetch.  ,Investors in both banks have been rattled, Credit Suisse shares are down 14% and Nomura's closed down 16% on the Japanese stock market. ,Fears over who else might be affected by the matter has prompted falls in the shares of other banks, including Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs, although by far smaller amounts.,Credit Suisse's fortunes are already facing a hit from its lending to Greensill Capital, the finance firm whose collapse has put at risk the future of the UK's Liberty Steel.,, Credit Suisse said: ""A significant US-based hedge fund defaulted on margin calls made last week by Credit Suisse and certain other banks. ,""Following the failure of the fund to meet these margin commitments, Credit Suisse and a number of other banks are in the process of exiting these positions.,""While at this time it is premature to quantify the exact size of the loss resulting from this exit, it could be highly significant and material to our first quarter results."",Neither named Archegos Capital Management, which, although not a household name, is a big player in US markets. ,It is the family investment firm of Bill Hwang, who was banned in 2014 from trading in Hong Kong, and in 2012 settled insider trading charges in the US.,The surprise default of a US hedge fund will send shivers through world stock markets. Traders will inevitably recall the demise two decades ago of Long Term Capital Management, a hedge fund that was one of the darlings of Wall Street only to collapse in the late 1990s. So big and complicated was its trading book that a bailout had to be organised among the US financial industry's biggest players, but before they stepped in there was a period of horrible uncertainty over whether the fund's demise might cause a large market crash.,At first sight Archegos does not look to be another LTCM - it is much smaller, and it appears to have been managing the money only of its founder and traders rather than for external investors. But one of the lessons of the 2008 crash is that the financial world is deeply interconnected, and it is difficult to gauge exactly what risks and trading positions individual hedge funds have built up. ,One of the curiosities of Archegos's default is that it was set up by Bill Hwang, a trader with a chequered past - he was banned from the Hong Kong market in 2014. Why banks like Credit Suisse and Nomura chose to have substantial business with his firm will be a subject of great interest to both institutions' senior management and shareholders.",business

""I worry about the day when Amy stops being alive in my head and in my heart. I don't want that day ever to come,"" she wrote.,Janis had been experiencing symptoms of MS for more than 20 years before being formally diagnosed.

The film was funded by nine European countries, including Bosnia-Herzegovina. ,""When we started on the film five years ago it looked like mission impossible,"" Žbanić explains. ,""Bosnia doesn't have a film industry. We produce around one film a year, with a budget of around €1m (£850,000). But this film, partly because of the extras we needed, would cost at least four times that and so had to be a co-production with other countries. ,""This is also a sensitive and painful topic, and as soon as we mentioned the word 'genocide', many people shied away, saying, 'It's too difficult.' Now I think, no, it's you who thinks an audience doesn't want to see difficult things.,""The awards nominations are such an incredible honour. A director always hopes their story will reach people's hearts in big numbers, and now we have the Bafta and Oscar nominations, I know how many more people will now see the movie."",One inspiration for the film was the book Under the UN Flag: The International Community and the Srebrenica Genocide by Hasan Nuhanović, but the director describes the main character of Aida as ""a combination of many people we met or read about"".,""Hasan was an interpreter who was there at Srebrenica and his family was expelled from the space,"" she explains. ""So I did approach him, but it was hard for him to have a film based upon him, and also I wanted a woman as the main character, who wanted to protect her sons and her husband. In the development there were many women as inspiration whose sons were at Srebrenica."",Kaouther Ben Hania's film, The Man Who Sold His Skin, stars Yahya Mahayni as Sam, a Syrian refugee who agrees to make himself into a human canvas and be displayed around European galleries. Italian actress Monica Bellucci has a supporting role as a gallery owner. ,The story is inspired by the ,, who agreed for his back to be tattooed by Belgian artist Wim Delvoye and then sold to a German art collector.,The director says she wants to show audiences how hard it is for a refugee to move around the world, compared with the movement of goods.,""It's not only easier for art to move around, it's easier for everything - for goods, for pasta, for fruits, for perfume, for fashion,"" she argues.,""My purpose is for the audience to live the experience of this refugee, who was a normal human being, but not 'born in the right place', as he says to the artist who meets him. ,""So, I wanted to give the possibility of empathy, to understand the journey of a refugee. But his journey is not a typical refugee journey. We don't have the boat, and it doesn't sink. He becomes a work of art. I wanted this combination between the survival world of the refugee and the luxurious world of contemporary art to make this contrast.,""The art market, like any institution, they have their codes, their way of functioning,"" she adds. ""So in the movie, the gallery owner, the museum guard, the museum director, they have the reflex of working with a work of art, because they signed a contract, and this is what they know. They can't deal with Sam as a human being."",Ben Hania describes her Oscar nomination as ""totally crazy"". ,""It's the first ever nomination for Tunisia, and I'd love to bring Africa an Oscar,"" she says.

""We never mentioned any female director in the history of film-making, so for four years I learned about genius men. ,""I was 17 when the war started so I didn't have access to many sources. Later, I was told by many of my colleagues that I should be with my small child instead of working when I was making my first film. ,""They just tried to put this guilt on me. But now audiences and film crews are getting used to the idea of a woman directing.,""And with this film it shows the female gaze is really different in war, and a different mindset. For me, war can't be sexy. I can't find pleasure in framing this with my camera."",Ben Hania's previous film, Beauty and the Dogs, premiered in 2017, months before the Harvey Weinstein scandal led to the #MeToo movement. It's the story of a young woman who is raped by male police officers.  ,""I think it's an international experience of women not being heard and not being believed,"" the director says. ""That film is the story of a young woman who is raped by policemen and she has to then go and report her rape to policemen.,""I think it was a very important movie for me to do, because when you are a woman, you face at some point in your life something like this. Somebody telling you to shut up, somebody reminding you that you are helpless, that you can't fight. So, I was doing this movie with all the anger and indignation I have as a woman."" ,The Oscars Academy's increasing diversity drive ""is changing things slowly, but it is really changing,"" she adds.,""There are now more voters outside the USA too, in Africa and Asia and Europe, so we definitely see this in the movies that are nominated.

https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-56487343,Josh O'Connor: Romeo role 'greatest experience of my career',"Last summer seemed the perfect time for O'Connor and Buckley to prove their talent in a well-known Shakespeare at an important venue. ,O'Connor's career had taken off with two roles - Larry in The Durrells for ITV followed by two seasons in The Crown as Prince Charles. (His successor as Charles is yet to be confirmed.) ,Buckley was in the much-praised Chernobyl then showed her range in the bio-pic Judy, playing the assistant assigned to keep Judy Garland on track in 1960s London.,But like almost everything on the National's schedule for 2020, its version of Romeo and Juliet was under threat as soon as the Covid pandemic hit.,O'Connor recalls ""Friday therapy sessions"" when some of those involved got together to try to work out what lay beyond the fog of Lockdown One. ,""It would be Jessie and myself and the director Simon Godwin and sometimes Fisayo Akinade (who plays Mercutio) and Rufus Norris, who runs the National. They were brilliant at keeping us all involved and motivated.,""But when they first came to us about making it a film instead, I think for both of us the reaction was absolutely not - not a chance mate. It just didn't seem the right idea. So thank goodness we followed through and engaged with it as a project.',The film is pacy, lasting just 90 minutes. It was shot over 17 days on and around the National's Lyttelton stage. In normal times the auditorium has an audience capacity of 890 but the seats remained empty.,Director Simon Godwin uses the stage and the areas around it like a film studio - in no way does it feel just like a play taped for TV. The production is fluid and well-lit and it works well.,O'Connor says when their Romeo and Juliet pivoted into a film they both pitched ideas on how it should be done. ""We brought in films to discuss and we talked about how we could make it theatrical and yet not shy away from the cinematic nature of what we were doing. ,""We always knew we wanted to include the building in some way. It lends a texture and tapestry to what you see. So there was a lot to think through but once we really got into it it was the greatest experience of my career. I was having the time of my life."",Buckley is from Killarney in south-west Ireland. She had read Shakespeare at secondary school but didn't see a production until she came to the UK to train as an actor.,""When I first read Shakespeare in Ireland I couldn't get my head around it at all and to be honest I didn't really enjoy it. But later at Rada (Royal Academy of Dramatic Art) in London I did a four-week Shakespeare course and that was the first time I felt a massive love-bomb had gone off."",The play is both love story and tragedy. Although from feuding families, Romeo and Juliet fall passionately in love.  A scheme is devised to keep them together which involves Juliet being induced into a death-like coma.  This does not end well. ,Some productions contrast the dark tragedy against sun-filled Italian settings. But Buckley says there are occasions when excitement comes from limitations imposed on the actors and director. ,""Obviously we ended up doing our production in a way no one had expected. But there was a lovely intimacy to being in the Lyttelton."",She thinks the empty seats helped. ""The theatre was our friend because we knew it was there just a few feet away behind this iron curtain even when we couldn't see it. To me it represented the world beyond the small world Romeo and Juliet live in in Verona. ,""Normally when you're doing theatre you'll always be aware of the audience. Maybe it's someone coughing or whatever but in any case you can't not feel them there and even filming you think of their presence."",Both actors enjoyed the forcible merging of the worlds of theatre and film-making, which generally remain pretty separate. O'Connor says everyone on the project was learning a lot from everyone else.,'There were eureka moments - thinking of course, '""Well why wouldn't the cinematographer be in on rehearsals? Why shouldn't the script supervisor be talking to the dialect coach?' Those kind of relationships felt beautiful and magical. It would be so great if that sort of experimentation continued."",Shakespeare most likely wrote Romeo and Juliet in 1595 at a time when roles on stage were always taken by men and boys. In the text Juliet is described as 13 and usually it's assumed Romeo is a little older. ,Neither O'Connor nor Buckley is trying to come across on screen as a teenager. He thinks the youthfulness of Romeo and Juliet can be a hindrance.,""It makes you lazy because you simply accept the idea they somehow just fall in love and they're naïve and that's all there is to it - they're ready to die for each other because it's first love and they don't realise you can fall in love again. ,""In stripping ourselves of all that you can look at the story in other ways. What if death to them represents hope or everlasting love or being together in the afterlife?"",In the UK there are the first tentative signs of theatre awakening from its own year-long sleep as the fight against coronavirus bears fruit - though everyone in the theatre is aware similar optimism last autumn proved misplaced. ,A few venues have now announced reopening dates, and the National hopes to resume live performances on 16 June with Under Milk Wood in its Olivier Theatre. ,But if O'Connor and Buckley could return to live theatre soon, is there another Shakespeare they'd want to take on? Buckley says she'd love to tackle Isabella in Measure for Measure. For O'Connor it's Richard II.,""But if it was with Jessie again I think we'd make bloody good Macbeths one day - it would be a barrel of laughs. But maybe we should wait until we're a bit older.""",arts_culture
https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-56537339,The lost letters that found New York drag scene's secret trailblazers,"Stories from the lives of several drag artists living in 50s New York, who constantly risked arrest and forced hospitalisation, have been told in the documentary ,.,Its producer Craig Olsen discovered the cache of letters in 2014, all written to a DJ called Reno Martin, who later moved to Hollywood and died in 2010.,""I won't give away how they came into my hands,"" he says, ""but I picked up a box of beautiful letters written between 1955 and the late 1960s, and I felt I shouldn't be reading them. ,""They were so juicy, so full of personal stories, of people laying their hearts on the line. They were all written to someone called Reno Martin by drag queens working in the New York scene in the 1950s.,""I love the art of drag,"" Olsen adds. ""I love that art form, and I do believe had anyone else found them, they'd have gone into the trash. Myself and the filmmakers knew they were bigger than just reading them round a dinner table with friends; they needed to be shared with the world."",Olsen and the film's co-directors Jennifer Tiexiera and Michael Seligman - a writer and producer on Ru Paul's Drag Race - managed to track down several of the authors of the letters, who were all now in their 80s and 90s and living across the United States.,""The youngest was 84 and the oldest was 96,"" Tiexiera remembers, ""and we were asking them about events that happened 60 years ago, but they were so alive, so mentally alert, and they remembered everything."",The film, which is showing at the ,, intersperses narrated extracts from the letters, many of them from a Daphne or a Josephine. Archive video and photos also feature, with interviewees recounting their experience of drag culture and queer life in 50s and 60s New York. ,They worked at drag balls and in nightclubs, including one, Club 82, which the filmmakers discovered had mafia links, yet was so famous that celebrities including the Kennedys and Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton were attendees. ,But it was only inside that tolerance was extended to the performers, Olsen says. ""It was a spectacle and a form of entertainment but outside of that, it was not ok,"" he points out.,Social historians who are interviewed in the film stress the importance of the letters, saying much of their research is based upon police and hospital records, due to the treatment of the gay community at the time.,""There's been very little education on this, and how the drag art form has come about,"" says Olsen. ""It was illegal to be in drag in the USA at the time. If you were caught masquerading as a woman, you'd get six months to a year in prison. They were living a dangerous life."",Some of the letter writers prefer to be called ""female impersonators"" on screen, rather than ""drag queens"" - which Tiexiera says she hopes ""might lead to education on what people want to be called, and how language changes over time."",Even within the gay community of 1950s New York, Craig Olsen describes the interviewees as ""a minority within a minority."" ,""To some in the gay community, drag has been viewed as a fetish, but actually it's an art form,"" he argues. ""And what if you were told you couldn't do your art? What are you left with?"",Tiexiera says the success of a reality TV show such as Ru Paul's Drag Race, which has just finished its ,, was greeted with incredulity by their interviewees.,""We asked our subjects about it,"" she recalls, ""and across the board, they all said they never thought they'd be alive to see drag artists on television, and it blows their mind. To be doing what they were doing, they had to be unapologetically themselves and had to be insanely bold. They were embarrassing to their peers. ,""We also take a couple of our subjects to the NYC Drag March, and the reason there is one is that drag queens were not allowed to the gay Pride march at the time."" ,Club 82 is in the process of being restored as a landmark of LGBT history, and the filmmakers also hope at some point to physically reunite their interviewees.  ,Tiexiera adds that these octogenarians and nonagenarians were still largely unaware that they were pioneers.,""I don't think they have any regrets at all about their lives, they all said they needed to be happy and would have done the same things over again,"" she says. ""They just had to be true to themselves, and kept saying to us, 'I don't know why you guys want to tell this story.',""I hope there's a couple of takeaways from the film,"" she adds. ""Scour your attics and basements and talk to your elders. The youth now really needs to record their history, particularly trans youth. ,""I feel very little exists for these communities, and it's so important to have this reference point of who they are and where they come from. In the 1950s, so much was destroyed from this time period because it was considered so shameful."",Olsen adds: ""I just think it's important to know that these kinds of letters do not exist in any archive in the USA, and that's what makes them so special.,""It's the only thing out there that shows this period for queer life.""",arts_culture

As you get mature you realise that it's a valid ambition - but it's a dream.""  ,For Leila Hassan Howe, Black Power was not just a social movement for freedom and peace, but a ""fight for rights and equal justice"". ,""If there was an anthem which really expressed the militancy, that was Blood and Fire by Niney and Big Youth,"" she says. ,""Marley's War reminded me of the international link of the movement, because he talks about people in Zimbabwe, Angola, Mozambique... and he performed this song in Africa."" ,Music was big in the UK in the 70s, and Leila says: ""You're hearing James Brown, Marvin Gaye. You are hearing all this wonderful music, and then Curtis Mayfield would come on and there was just a different atmosphere. The music was new and different and Move On Up was a wonderful song."" ,While Leila admits she was a Beatles fan, she says: ""That was much more on a superficial pop level. The music that emotionally got me was black music, like Duke Ellington's."" ,Then, Aretha comes into play. ""There is no singer but Aretha Franklin, although my friends recently reminded me that I was more of a Roberta Flack type, and that's very true."" ,Her last words are for Nina Simone: ""Make sure you listen to her song, Four Women,"" she suggests. ,Zainab Abbas was only 18 when in 1968 she heard Say It Loud (I'm Black and I'm Proud) by James Brown. ""It's so powerful,"" she recalls, ""even when my granddaughter hears it now, she bristles."",At that time, many black Britons were inspired by American movements. ""I describe the civil rights movement as the pain in my heart; I describe Malcolm X as my liberation, because they [American activists] had the ability to express what was in our hearts,"" explains Zainab.,For her, Gil Scott-Heron's The Revolution Will Not Be Televised is a Black Power must, and Zainab recalls him giving her a pile of free tickets to distribute to black people to see his concert in London. ,She adds: ""Bob Marley and his Redemption Song didn't come out until 1980, but that song has the best line ever. 'How long shall they kill our prophets, while we stand aside and look?'."" ,Zainab thinks history has not given black women in the movement enough credit.,""Look at Altheia Jones-LeCointe, she was a Panther. She is one of the most fearless women I've ever met."",In 1972, Winston Trew was jailed alongside three other young black men ,The group, known as the Oval Four, spent eight months behind bars for assaulting a police officer and attempted theft. The Court of Appeal has now quashed these convictions, but it took nearly 50 years.  ,""When I came out of prison, I was angry. Bob Marley wrote a song called Duppy Conqueror, which helped me control my mind,"" he explains. ,But it is self-empowerment that was the key to Winston's activism. ""I first heard To Be Young, Gifted and Black when I joined the Black Power movement in 1970. I'd just turned 20.""  ,He had become a member of The Fasimbas, a Black Power group promoting education and self-defence. ""I had found a place where I could belong. Then, I heard this song and it all gelled together: of course, I am gifted. We all were.""  ,For Winston, Nina Simone's song evokes feelings of triumph and tragedy. ,""One of the verses says: 'When you are feeling really low, there's a great truth that you should know, when you're young, gifted and black, your soul's intact'. ,""One of the things that racism tries to do is to make you destroy yourself inside. But my sense of self was not destroyed at all; it made me even stronger."" ,The retired lecturer adds: ""I am old, but still gifted and black.""  ",arts_culture
https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-56428543,Not just the Proms: An unexpected history of the Royal Albert Hall,"On the 150th anniversary of its opening, its archive manager Liz Harper insists ""the idea of it being an elitist venue is just not true,"" describing it as the ""nation's village hall"" because of its eclectic events and occupants.,So, from the flushed faces of middle England bobbing beneath their Union Jacks to the flushed lavatories reinforced for Sumo competitors, here are some of the Royal Albert Hall's highs and lows over the past century and a half.,Prince Albert, along with Henry Cole - a civil servant with a passion for art and industrial design - organised 1851's hugely popular ,; a world fair which was held in Hyde Park.,The profits of that were used to buy land and develop institutions in South Kensington, including the Natural History Museum, the V&A, and Imperial College. ,The centrepiece of this area of academia and aestheticism was a giant hall, the manifestation of Prince Albert's idea of a hub where people could gather and share ideas. At the opening ceremony on 29 March 1871, Queen Victoria was overcome by emotion (she was not amused), and her son the Prince of Wales had to speak on her behalf.  ,Money was raised for construction by selling tickets in advance. The first 20 were bought by Queen Victoria. They still make up the royal box. ,The building was designed by engineers rather than architects, with the emphasis placed firmly on functionality. Taking almost four years to build, it ,""Even when it first opened, people said it wasn't the most beautiful,"" explains Ms Harper.,""But as a functional public building I think it's stood the test of time."" ,It was far from plain sailing. During the first few years, the hall hosted various events with mixed success. ,Ms Harper says popular shows included huge thousand-person choirs: ""It was before the age of microphones so it would really have been a wall of sound - and it was those things which really were crowd-pleasers"", as were penny subscription concerts, where people would pay 1d to attend a series of concerts.,Other shows ""just seem nuts now"", Ms Harper says. In March 1891, the hall was altered to resemble a city inspired by Lord Lytton's science fiction story,, (,) in which Earth is threatened by a winged master race called Vril-ya. ,Thought to be the first ever sci-fi convention, exhibitors included a fortune-telling dog, various Vril-themed magic shows, and mannequins representing the Vril-ya.,The novel was exceedingly popular with Victorians, who were quick to dress in costume for the event, with many donning wings. A more down-to-earth element was provided by possibly the longest-lasting legacy of the futuristic story: Bovril.,Worn-out attendees could pep themselves up with a cup of the hot beef extract, which had a display stall at the convention.,Its inventor named the drink by combining the words ""bovine"" and ""Vril"". It was intended to symbolise the energy a mug of the salty blood-based liquid would give the drinker, and was probably an improvement on its original name of ""Johnston's Fluid Beef"". ,Never ones to do things by half, the Victorians also put on massive fetes, including one where they built a normal-sized church in the auditorium. The 1911 Shakespeare Memorial Ball saw the auditorium transformed with green lawns and real flowers, leading a rather star-struck newspaper reporter to write ""never has the effect of a fancy dress ball, taken as a whole, been more wonderful or more complete"".,Costume Balls proved a good money-spinner - the first was held in 1883 by a London gentleman's club The Savage Club, and Chelsea Arts Club Balls happened annually from 1910 until 1958.  ,Renowned for their exuberance and extravaganza, thousands of revellers dressed in historic or exotic outfits and cavorted on carnival floats driven around inside the huge auditorium.,The great hall hosted a number of ground-breaking events - not just the first sci-fi convention.,What is thought to be the world's debut bodybuilding contest, in 1901, saw 60 competitors trying to prove to a group of three judges who had the brawniest muscles. ,Britain's first indoor marathon was held in December 1909, when two athletes - Italian Dorando Pietri and London-based C W Gardiner - attempted to run 524 laps of the auditorium.,Only Gardiner finished the race, completing the course in 2 hours and 37 minutes.,The first table tennis World Championship was played at the venue for five days in January 1938.,And the first sumo wrestling tournament held outside Japan in the sport's 1,500-year history took place in the hall in October 1991, an event that necessitated the reinforcement of chairs, installation of extra-large showers and the weight-testing of toilets.,As is to be expected, a venue that attracted such a range of events also pulled in the famous faces. Slightly oddly, the Sherlock Holmes creator Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was a judge for the rippling hunks in the bodybuilding competition. ,He also sort-of turned up from beyond the grave. A séance was held days after his death in July 1930, in which a clairvoyant tried to contact him in front of an audience of 10,000 people and his widow, Jean.,Apparently her husband was reached, he passed on a message, and Lady Conan Doyle was ""perfectly convinced"" by the experience,  which she found both ""cheering and encouraging"".,John Lennon appeared at the hall a few times - on one occasion triggering members of the audience to exhibit more than perhaps planned. In 1968 he and wife Yoko Ono put on a display called Alchemical Wedding, in which they sat in a large white bag while a man played a flute. ,Some of the crowd showed their appreciation by getting naked in the auditorium.,Fortunately clothes were on the menu in November 1985, which saw the arrival of Fashion Aid, a star-studded fashion-based off-shoot of Band Aid. It culminated with a fake runway wedding between Queen singer Freddie Mercury and actress Jane Seymour.,Not just the perfect place for the peculiar, the hall has seen its fair share of politics. Suffragists, suffragettes and anti-suffrage campaigners all rallied in the hall, which the suffragettes named their ""Temple of Liberty"".  ,It was where Emmeline Pankhurst famously announced: ""I incite this meeting to rebellion. Be militant each in your own way. I accept the responsibility for everything you do."",""Lots of things have come forward from the hall to make wider social changes,"" says Ms Harper.,""It was the largest venue where they could hire and it was where they raised the most funding. ,""Women would literally take off their jewellery, their rings, their necklaces to put in the offering which was going round"".,The Suffragettes also have the dubious honour of becoming the first political group to be banned from the hall after some of the trustees became concerned that Pankhurst's call for militancy could lead to trouble.,The auditorium was also the destination for several large meetings held by the British Union of Fascists during the 1930s. The Times newspaper reported that at one, in March 1935, the aisles were filled with Blackshirt squads who beat drums and sounded bugles. ,Ms Harper says the current booking system is comparatively strict. ""Back then, as long as they didn't damage the hall, the trustees would take a booking from them because they needed revenue"". ,Pop and rock was once officially banned from the venue after performances by bands like Mott The Hoople and The Nice saw people ripping down curtains and breaking through the floor in the boxes.,Ms Harper says this meant the hall ""wasn't quite the really exciting place"" it had been in the 1950s and 1960s.,""You'd had these big counter-culture poetry gatherings, and massive rock gigs with Jimi Hendrix. And then in the 1970s you just had artists who were more like crooners"".,The ban was never officially lifted but as the management changed, the bands gradually returned.,In addition to indoor marathons and sumo wrestling, sport has played an important part at the hall, with tennis championships, boxing matches and table tennis championships all being held inside the hall.,The pandemic has delayed the hall's , but chief executive Craig Hassall says he wants the programme to reflect the essence of what Prince Albert had planned all those years ago.,The Proms will return, along with their last night flag-waving. Both classical and pop ,, as are ballet performances, ballroom dancing competitions and gala evenings.,Or maybe Arthur Conan Doyle will make another return from beyond the veil - and this time he might be joined by some other Royal Albert Hall ghosts. Perhaps John Lennon, Freddie Mercury, Emmeline Pankhurst and Queen Victoria could share a nice cup of fortifying ""fluid beef"".",arts_culture

So to be nominated for three has blown my mind,"" said the musician.,A more highly-publicised rule change allowed any artist who has been a permanent resident in the UK for more than five years to become eligible for nomination.,That opened the door for British-Japanese pop star Rina Sawayama, who had previously been told she was ""not British enough"" to enter the awards.,She ended up with a nomination in the rising star category and said she ""literally fell to the floor"" when the news broke.,The winner of that prize is announced in advance, however, ,.,For reasons best known to themselves, the Brits scrapped the best international group prize in 2020 - causing uproar amongst the BTS Army.,""The Brit Awards straight up robbed BTS,"" ,. ,""They kept best international male and female,"" ,.

With a proliferation of radio stations, streaming services and other ways to access music, the idea of a universally recognisable hit is dwindling. ,Over the last 10 years, there have only been a handful of crossover songs.

Taken together, the nominees reflect the strength and diversity of our music scene... and UK rap is absolutely the defining sound of 21st Century Britain.,But a healthy scene also needs big hits to rally around.

https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/us/politics/infrastructure-crisis-united-states-projects.html,The Infrastructure Crisis That Biden Is Confronting,"Speaking outside Pittsburgh today, President Biden outlined a $2 trillion plan to invest in the country’s infrastructure, creating millions of jobs in the process.,“It’s time to build our economy from the bottom up and the middle out, not the top down,” he declared, calling the plan “a once-in-a-generation investment in America, unlike anything we’ve seen or done since we built the interstate highway system and the space race decades ago.”,Public investment in infrastructure, as a share of gross domestic product, has been , for the past half-century, and it has recently become a topic of growing concern across party lines. President Donald Trump proposed , in 2018, though it was not as far-reaching as Biden’s plan, and it never became law.,So how did we get to a place where major infrastructure improvements are so clearly necessary — and what are the biggest needs?,The American Society of Civil Engineers has been releasing an Infrastructure Report Card every four years for over two decades, and the evaluations have never been very positive.,This month , its latest ,, giving the United States’ infrastructure a C- over all. That’s a shabby grade, but it reflects a modest amount of recent improvement: It is the first time that the overall score has been higher than a D+.,“We’ve made a little bit of incremental progress,” Emily Feenstra, the engineering society’s managing director for government relations and infrastructure initiatives, said in an interview today, adding that these improvements had been made largely at the state and local levels.,“What you’ve seen is treading water, almost nibbling away at the margins, when it comes to our nation’s infrastructure,” Feenstra said. “Cities and states are doing what they can to invest, funding new technologies, but there hasn’t been that kind of transformational investment that would really give us the bump up to put us on good economic footing.”,The report card analyzes the nation’s infrastructure in 17 categories, including roads, schools, transit and drinking water. Bridges were the only category in which the grade had declined from four years ago, now sitting at a C. Eleven categories have a grade in the D range, reflecting the extent to which bridges and other transportation infrastructure , in recent decades.,The coronavirus pandemic has heightened the need for federal assistance in a number of ways, including on the transit front, as , has sent revenues plummeting — putting , on already hard-up transportation systems at both the local and national levels.,But most of the nation’s infrastructure needs are longstanding, and many have to do with climate change. Storm-water infrastructure, for instance, was the one new category on the report card this year.,The extreme weather that compromised the power grid in Texas last month , of the ways in which climate change can threaten systems that lacked strong public investment. And it highlighted the ways in which infrastructure systems are intertwined.,Biden’s infrastructure proposal defines its purpose broadly, something that has pleased analysts at the engineering society. “It’s nice to see the comprehensive approach,” Feenstra said. “Not just roads, bridges, transit — which are important — but also water, schools, things that can alleviate storms’ impact. That really is key, because as much as we silo things into these 17 categories, we do emphasize that infrastructure is all interlinked, and events like Texas put that at the forefront.”,Biden’s proposal offers a framework, but he will have to work with Congress to write the legislation. Last year the Democratically controlled House trotted out a $1.5 trillion infrastructure bill, the Moving Forward Act, elements of which could wind up in a final bill. It included hundreds of billions of dollars for repairing roads and bridges, funding other transit projects, making improvements to school buildings, constructing affordable housing and enhancing broadband access.,Parts of other bills floating around the House could also wind up in the final package, including the ,, which would lay out a plan to eliminate fossil fuels from the United States’ electricity supply by 2035, and the ,, which seeks to stabilize Amtrak’s funding by creating a trust fund.,Although both Democratic and Republican leaders have expressed support for a major infrastructure project, it’s not yet clear that Biden’s push will get any backing from Republicans.,The president has said that he will pay for it by raising taxes on corporations and on Americans making more than $400,000 a year, a proposal that Republicans are unlikely to get behind. One big advantage for Biden: Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, the most conservative Democrat in the chamber, has said that he supports making large-scale investments in infrastructure.,But there’s also one big possible hangup: Manchin, more than almost any other influential Democrat, has a strong desire for bipartisan compromise and could balk at a proposal that fails to garner any Republican support.,“I’m going to bring Republicans into the Oval Office, listen to them and what they have to say, and be open to other ideas,” Biden said today. “We’ll have a good-faith negotiation with any Republican who wants to help get this done — but we have to get it done.”",politics

It also spared Democratic leaders from having to weigh in on whether to throw out the results of a contested vote months after President Donald J. Trump’s false claims of a stolen election fueled a partisan clash and a deadly riot at the Capitol.,Republicans had signaled that they were ready to turn the dispute into a political cudgel against the majority party, and some vulnerable Democrats who had come under attack on the issue in their districts were deeply uncomfortable with the prospect of intervening.,In a statement on Wednesday, Ms. Hart repeated her claim that voters had been “silenced” but acknowledged that the contest had become politically contentious.,“Despite our best efforts to have every vote counted, the reality is that the toxic campaign of political disinformation to attack this constitutional review of the closest congressional contest in 100 years has effectively silenced the voices of Iowans,” she said. “It is a stain on our democracy that the truth has not prevailed, and my hope for the future is a return to decency and civility.”,Ms. Hart’s campaign had , that they believed were legally cast but “wrongfully” uncounted by state election officials during a districtwide recount in the fall. Rather than taking her case to court in Iowa before the election was certified, Ms. Hart opted to wait and appeal the results to the House Administration Committee, invoking a 1960s law.,With Democrats in control of the chamber, they would have run the review and had the power to order their own recount and a vote by the full House on whether to unseat Ms. Miller-Meeks in favor of their own candidate, which would have added to their eight-seat majority.,“I’m deeply appreciative that we’re ending this now,” Ms. Miller-Meeks said in a recorded statement on Wednesday evening. “It’s time to move forward, to unite as one group of people supporting Iowa’s Second Congressional District.”,Democratic leaders had argued that they were obliged to take the appeal seriously, but Republicans mobilized, accusing them of hypocrisy and trying to steal an election that had been verified by state officials. To drive home the point, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the Republican leader, flew to Iowa on Wednesday before Ms. Hart’s announcement to rail against what he called an attempted political power grab intended to pad Democrats’ margin of control.,“Iowans made a decision,” Mr. McCarthy said. “And it’s their voice, and they have a right to have Congresswoman Mariannette Miller-Meeks, who they elected, to continue to serve them.”,The dispute was a particularly tricky issue for politically vulnerable House Democrats, who have become targets of a coordinated pressure campaign on the matter. Republicans’ campaign arm found that , for them in the competitive districts they hope to flip in 2022.,The National Republican Congressional Committee specifically targeted Representative Cindy Axne, Democrat of Iowa, releasing , accusing her of being complicit in an attempt to overturn the will of the state’s voters.,An affiliated political action committee, American Action Network, announced last week that it would “spend mid-five figures on phone calls” in swing districts held by Democrats urging voters to oppose Ms. Hart’s efforts.",politics

Trump and the Trump Organization have subpoenaed the personal bank records of the company’s chief financial officer and are questioning gifts he and his family received from Mr. Trump, according to people with knowledge of the matter.,In recent weeks, the prosecutors have , on the executive, Allen H. Weisselberg, in what appears to be a determined effort to gain his cooperation. Mr. Weisselberg, who has not been accused of wrongdoing, has overseen the Trump Organization’s finances for decades and may hold the key to any possible criminal case in New York against the former president and his family business.,Prosecutors working for the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., are examining, among other things, whether Mr. Trump and the company falsely manipulated property values to obtain loans and tax benefits.,It is unclear whether Mr. Weisselberg would cooperate with the investigation and neither his lawyer, Mary E. Mulligan, nor Mr. Vance’s office would comment. But if a review of his personal finances were to uncover possible wrongdoing, prosecutors could then use that information to press Mr. Weisselberg to guide them through the inner workings of the company. The 73-year-old accountant began his career working for Mr. Trump’s father.,Separately, the prosecutors are also seeking a new round of internal documents from the Trump Organization, including general ledgers from several of its more than two dozen properties that the company did not turn over last year, according to the people with knowledge of the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive details.,The ledgers offer a line-by-line breakdown of each property’s financial situation, including daily receipts, checks and revenues. The prosecutors could compare those details against the information the company provided to its lenders and local tax authorities to assess whether it fraudulently misled them.,Mr. Vance’s office has also subpoenaed records from several banks where Mr. Trump or his company had accounts, including JPMorgan Chase and Capital One, according to people with knowledge of subpoenas served on the banks.,The previously unreported developments underscore the escalation of the investigation after Mr. Vance’s office obtained Mr. Trump’s tax records and other underlying financial documents in February. They were released over Mr. Trump’s objections after a lengthy legal battle that culminated in a ,.,The Trump Organization declined to comment. In the past, Mr. Trump, a Republican, has denied any wrongdoing and has slammed the investigation as a long-running and politically motivated “fishing expedition.” Mr. Vance, a Democrat, recently announced that ,.,The investigation has centered on some of Mr. Trump’s most prominent properties: Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, the Trump hotels in New York and Chicago and the ,. In addition to possible tax- and bank-related fraud, the prosecutors are examining the Trump Organization’s statements to insurance companies about the value of various assets.,Prosecutors have subpoenaed records from a firm hired by Deutsche Bank, one of the former president’s main lenders, to assess the value of three Trump hotels with Deutsche Bank loans, people with knowledge of the matter said. The firm reviewed the operations of restaurants, bars and gift shops at the hotels, one of the people said.,Last year, the prosecutors , Deutsche Bank itself and Mr. Trump’s other main lender, Ladder Capital, which sold its Trump Organization loans years ago. Both banks are cooperating with the prosecutors.,It is unclear whether the prosecutors will ultimately file any charges. But if a case were built against the Trump Organization based on the loan documents, the company’s lawyers could argue that Deutsche Bank and Ladder Capital are sophisticated financial institutions that conducted their own analysis of Mr. Trump’s properties without relying on the company’s internal assessments. The lawyers could also emphasize that providing different valuations for a property depending on the situation — for example, on a loan application or in appealing local property taxes — is common and appropriate in New York’s real estate industry, in part because there are varying methods for calculating property values.,Outside accountants also vet the information provided to local tax authorities, potentially reducing the likelihood of fraud. Mr. Trump has argued that his tax returns “were done by among the biggest and most prestigious law and accounting firms in the U.S.”,In addition to the fraud investigation, Mr. Vance’s office continues to focus on its original target: the Trump Organization’s role in paying hush money during the 2016 presidential campaign to two women who said they had affairs with Mr. Trump.,Mr. Trump’s former personal lawyer and fixer, Michael D. Cohen, paid $130,000 to buy the silence of one of the women, Stephanie Clifford, the pornographic film actress who performed as Stormy Daniels. The Trump Organization later reimbursed Mr. Cohen, and Mr. Vance’s office has scrutinized whether the company properly accounted for the $130,000 payment.,Mr. Cohen, who in 2018 pleaded guilty to federal campaign finance charges for his role in the hush-money scheme, has long implicated Mr. Weisselberg, alleging that he helped devise a strategy to mask the reimbursements. The federal prosecutors who charged Mr. Cohen did not accuse Mr. Weisselberg of wrongdoing.,Mr. Cohen is now cooperating with Mr. Vance’s investigation and has met with prosecutors several times, including to review some of Mr. Trump’s financial documents. Lanny Davis, a lawyer for Mr. Cohen, declined to comment.,The prosecutors have also questioned Mr. Weisselberg’s former daughter-in-law, Jennifer Weisselberg, she has said. Ms. Weisselberg has been enmeshed in a bitter divorce with Mr. Weisselberg’s son, Barry, who manages the Trump Wollman Rink in Central Park.,Ms. Weisselberg said in an interview that prosecutors have asked her about a number of gifts that Mr. Trump and his company gave the Weisselberg family over the years. These include an apartment on Central Park South for Ms. Weisselberg and her former husband, cars leased for several family members and private school tuition.,The scrutiny of the gifts appears to be part of an effort to paint a picture of Mr. Weisselberg’s financial life, as is common when prosecutors seek cooperation from a potential witness.

The force has more than 2,000 officers.,Lawyers for the officers and for Mr. Trump could not be reached for comment early Wednesday. Mr. Trump has previously denied responsibility for the attack.,The complaint said the “insurrectionist mob” that stormed the Capitol was “spurred on by Trump’s conduct over many months in getting his followers to believe” his , in November. The complaint also said that Mr. Trump’s supporters believed swarming the Capitol was their last chance to stop Mr. Trump from being unfairly forced out of the White House.,Mr. Trump “inflamed, encouraged, incited, directed, and aided and abetted” the mob that overran the building and attacked police personnel inside, the complaint said. It cited Mr. Trump’s Jan. 6 speech and other conduct, including what it said was his failure that day to “take timely action to stop his followers from continued violence.”,During the attack, Officer Hemby, an 11-year veteran of the Capitol Police, was outside the building, crushed against the side and sprayed with chemicals that burned his eyes, skin and throat, the complaint said.

Inquiry Over Sex With an Underage Girl,"Representative Matt Gaetz, Republican of Florida and a close ally of former President Donald J. Trump, is being investigated by the Justice Department over whether he had a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old and paid for her to travel with him, according to three people briefed on the matter.,Investigators are examining whether Mr. Gaetz violated federal sex trafficking laws, the people said. A variety of federal statutes make it illegal to induce someone under 18 to travel over state lines to engage in sex in exchange for money or something of value. The Justice Department regularly prosecutes such cases, and offenders often receive severe sentences.,It was not clear how Mr. Gaetz met the girl, believed to be 17 at the time of encounters about two years ago that investigators are scrutinizing, according to two of the people.,The investigation was opened in the final months of the Trump administration under Attorney General William P. Barr, the two people said. Given Mr. Gaetz’s national profile, senior Justice Department officials in Washington — including some appointed by Mr. Trump — were notified of the investigation, the people said.,The three people said that the examination of Mr. Gaetz, 38, is part of a broader investigation into a political ally of his, a local official in Florida named Joel Greenberg, who was indicted last summer on ,, , sex trafficking of a child and financially supporting people in exchange for sex, at least one of whom was an underage girl.,Mr. Greenberg, who has since resigned his post as tax collector in Seminole County, north of Orlando, visited the White House with Mr. Gaetz in 2019, ,.,No charges have been brought against Mr. Gaetz, and the extent of his criminal exposure is unclear.,Mr. Gaetz said in an interview that his lawyers had been in touch with the Justice Department and that they were told he was the subject, not the target, of an investigation. “I only know that it has to do with women,” Mr. Gaetz said. “I have a suspicion that someone is trying to recategorize my generosity to ex-girlfriends as something more untoward.”,Mr. Gaetz called the investigation part of an elaborate scheme involving “false sex allegations” to extort him and his family for $25 million that began this month. He said he and his father, Don Gaetz, had been cooperating with the F.B.I. and “wearing a wire” after they were approached by people saying they could make the investigation “go away.” Mr. Gaetz claimed the disclosure of the sex trafficking inquiry was intended to thwart an investigation into the extortion plot.,In a second interview later Tuesday, the congressman said he had no plans to resign his House seat and denied that he had romantic relationships with minors. “It is verifiably false that I have traveled with a 17-year-old woman,” he said.,Representatives for the Justice Department and the F.B.I. declined to comment, as did a spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney’s office in Central Florida.,Mr. Greenberg pleaded not guilty last year and was sent to jail this month for violating the terms of his bail. He is scheduled to go on trial in June in Orlando.,A frequent presence on Fox News and other conservative media, Mr. Gaetz has recently mused with confidants about quitting elected politics and taking a full-time job with the conservative television channel Newsmax or another network, according to a person familiar with the conversations. Axios , on Tuesday that Mr. Gaetz was considering leaving Congress.,Mr. Greenberg maintained ties to controversial figures who have supported Mr. Trump, an examination of court records, social media posts and far-right websites showed. A website run by a member of the far-right group the Proud Boys and a network of fake social media accounts linked to Mr. Trump’s longtime political adviser Roger J. Stone Jr. have promoted false accusations about Mr. Greenberg’s rivals similar to rumors that prosecutors accused Mr. Greenberg of secretly trying to spread.,It was not clear how Mr. Greenberg knew either Mr. Gaetz or Mr. Stone. He posted a selfie with both in 2017, ,, “Great catching up.” The following year, Mr. Gaetz expressed support for Mr. Greenberg’s successful bid for local office, predicting he would someday make a great member of Congress.,On Capitol Hill, Mr. Gaetz has , to the left as much as he has served as one of Mr. Trump’s staunchest defenders and enablers, often with theatrical flair. He wore a gas mask on the House floor last year in the early days of the pandemic, insisting he was demonstrating concern for public safety amid accusations he was mocking the seriousness of the spread of the coronavirus.,Mr. Gaetz was first elected to Congress in 2016. As a member of the Florida State Legislature and the scion of a Republican political family, he had initially backed former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida in the Republican presidential primary that year before hitching his political fortunes to Mr. Trump.,It paid off. He won a seat in Congress representing part of the Florida Panhandle, and as one of Mr. Trump’s most flamboyant supporters on Capitol Hill and on cable television, his profile skyrocketed.,Mr. Gaetz invited a right-wing Holocaust denier to the State of the Union address in 2018, and attended an event last year where ,, though he has distanced himself from the group on his podcast. When Democrats moved in 2019 to ,, Mr. Gaetz and a phalanx of Republicans following him , to briefly break up the investigation into the president.,After Mr. Trump’s defeat last year, Mr. Gaetz once again rallied to his side, defending the president’s baseless claims of widespread election fraud. Mr. Gaetz , during Congress’s certification of it on Jan. 6 that was disrupted for hours by a pro-Trump mob that stormed the Capitol. Mr. Gaetz later traveled to Wyoming to hold a rally against Representative Liz Cheney, a Republican leader who had ,.,In 2017, Mr. Gaetz was the only member of Congress to vote against a law that gave the federal government more power and money to fight human trafficking.,“Voters in Northwest Florida did not send me to Washington to go and create more federal government,” Mr. Gaetz said in a local television interview at the time. “If anything, we should be abolishing a lot of the agencies at the federal level.”,Mr. Gaetz’s personal life has gained attention before. Last summer, he announced that he had a son, Nestor Galban, 19, though Mr. Gaetz said he was not Mr. Galban’s biological father, nor had he adopted him. Mr. Galban had been 12 when they met and had come to the United States from Cuba; Mr. Gaetz was at the time dating Mr. Galban’s sister.,“He is a part of my family story,” Mr. Gaetz , in June. “My work with Nestor, our family, no element of my public service could compare to the joy that our family has brought me.”,Mr. Gaetz is now , to an analyst named Ginger Luckey, 26, whom he , at Mr. Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club on Dec. 30.,It was unclear how investigators in the Greenberg case began examining Mr. Gaetz’s conduct. Last June, federal prosecutors secured , against Mr. Greenberg, accusing him of stalking a political rival.,Around that time, federal authorities seized Mr. Greenberg’s phone and laptop, according to court records. They discovered evidence that Mr. Greenberg, whose job responsibilities included issuing licenses, was creating fake identification cards for himself and a teenage girl, and was experimenting with holograms used on permits for concealed firearms, according to court documents.,Two months later, , on the sex trafficking charge. From May to November 2017, prosecutors said, Mr. Greenberg targeted the girl, who was between 14 and 17, saying he “recruited” and “solicited” her for sex acts in exchange for unspecified perks or favors.,Mr. Greenberg worked in advertising before running successfully at the age of 31 in 2016 for tax collector in Seminole County.,Within days of taking office, he fired three employees who had supported his predecessor and began spending more than $1.5 million in taxpayer money on personal expenses, including guns, ammunition, body armor and a drone, as well as on computers for his own cryptocurrency venture, a county audit later revealed.,The following year, ,, Mr. Greenberg posted a photograph of himself on social media with Milo Yiannopoulos, a right-wing personality who has a history of making racist remarks. The newspaper also detailed Mr. Greenberg’s own misogynist and anti-Muslim comments on Facebook.,In his bid for re-election, Mr. Greenberg turned in late 2019 to clandestine tactics to undermine a possible rival, according to court papers. Prosecutors said he sent an anonymous letter to the school where one potential candidate worked that made unfounded accusations of sexual misconduct with a student and making similar claims on a fake Facebook account.,As the primary race intensified last summer, similar messaging began appearing on fake social media accounts that have been tied to Mr. Stone.,“Watch out Seminole county,” said someone named April Goad on Facebook, warning Floridians “don’t open your door” to the rival candidate, according to Graphika, a company that specializes in analyzing social media.,The post linked to an article about the rival published on Central Florida Post, a website controlled by Mr. Stone’s associates that had written favorable articles about Mr. Greenberg.

https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/us/politics/transgender-troops-military.html,Pentagon Issues New Rules Overturning Trump’s Ban on Transgender Troops,"WASHINGTON — The Pentagon on Wednesday erased a Trump-era ban on transgender people serving in the military, issuing new rules that would offer them access to gender transition care and medical services denied under the Trump administration.,The sweeping guidelines allow transgender people to enlist and serve openly as the gender they identify with and receive medically necessary care authorized by law. They also prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender identity.,The change follows , , that restored protections put in place during the Obama administration that had opened the ranks of the armed services to transgender people. The order gave the Defense Department 60 days to evaluate the guidelines.,The Pentagon announced the shift on the same day that Mr. Biden proclaimed a transgender “day of visibility.” , and , posted on Twitter that “transgender rights are human rights” and called for Americans to stamp out discrimination against transgender people.,Advocates for the reversal of the ban were elated.,“We have consistently said that restoring a policy of full inclusion for transgender troops would be straightforward,” Aaron Belkin, the director of the Palm Center, said in a statement. “This is a big step toward making our military stronger and fairer, and it recognizes years of research showing that a single standard for all service members improves readiness and allows for the widest possible pool of qualified personnel.”,John F. Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, said during a news conference that the Defense Department would “lead by example” on the issue of transgender rights.,An estimated 1,000 to 8,000 service members identify as transgender, Stephanie Miller, the director of the Pentagon’s Office for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, said at the news conference, though Defense Department officials acknowledge that number is imprecise and could be higher. She also said that the estimated costs for medical treatment for transgender troops, which President Donald J. Trump cited as a reason for ,, would be “a handful of a million dollars” per year.,“The Pentagon absolutely did the right thing today by re-establishing a policy of inclusion for transgender service members, who once again will be able to serve openly and proudly in their self-identified gender,” Representative Jackie Speier, Democrat of California and a member of the House Armed Services Committee, said in a statement.,While the move was expected, the swiftness with which it happened signaled a willingness by the Biden administration to put its stamp on social issues at the Defense Department. The Pentagon has also been looking at how the military has handled sexual assault issues.,Mr. Biden and Defense Department leaders are also wrestling with a reckoning on race at the Pentagon, where officials have had to confront a stark fact: Close to one in five of those arrested in connection with breaching the Capitol on Jan. 6 have ties to the military, and many have ,.,After the attack, the Pentagon has held a series of sessions to address extremist and white supremacist groups in the military. One of the first things Lloyd J. Austin III did after becoming the defense secretary was to order a servicewide “stand down” to address extremism in the ranks. The term refers to an issue — in the past it was safety or sexual assault or suicide — that the secretary has decided is important enough that it needs to be addressed through discussions with troops worldwide.",politics
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/climate/biden-climate-jobs.html,"Biden’s Big Bet: Tackling Climate Change Will Create Jobs, Not Kill Them","WASHINGTON — In 2017, as Donald J. Trump was announcing the ,, the largest global effort to attack planetary warming, he declared, “I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.”,On Wednesday, President Biden traveled to Pittsburgh to try to make the opposite case: that the workers Mr. Trump was appealing to have more to gain from combating climate change than to lose.,It is going to be a tough bet. To Mr. Biden, a , is about creating union jobs, hundreds of thousands of them, in wind and solar power, electric cars and road- and bridge-building. Even those more basic infrastructure projects would have a climate angle: the new roads and bridges would be built to withstand the high waters and brutal storms of a changing climate.,“I am a union guy. I support unions, unions built the middle class. It is about time you start to get a piece of the action,” Mr. Biden said in Pittsburgh.,He promised “good paying jobs” for “American workers” making “American products.”,That is not a new pitch. For decades, Democrats have insisted “jobs versus the environment” is a false choice. But in the scale of his proposal and the audacity of his promises, Mr. Biden may be laying his political future on that idea.,He faces a lot of skepticism.,In Michigan, a state critical to the president’s political future, autoworkers know it takes fewer of them to build an electric car. Senator Joe Manchin III, the West Virginia Democrat whose vote could again decide the package’s fate, understands coal miners in his state would earn considerably less putting up wind turbines.,And in Pennsylvania, which put Mr. Biden over the top in November, and then hosted his speech on Wednesday, some union workers don’t see how skills honed over decades in fossil fuel industries would translate in a clean-energy future.,“They keep saying, ‘We’re going to transition you into solar jobs.’ That’s not how it works,” said Shawn Steffee, a leader of the Boilermakers Local 154 in Pittsburgh. “We build power plants, petrochemical plants and maintain steel mills.”,He asked, “Would you ask Tom Brady to play middle linebacker just because he’s a football player?”,Union leaders — some of whom switched from supporting Mr. Trump in 2016 to Mr. Biden in 2020 — say that for now, they will work with him to realize his vision of conquering climate change, even as it transforms their workplaces.,But they are skeptical that the well-paying union jobs the president promises will materialize, noting that, so far, the ecosystem of manufacturers, contractors and utility developers that has grown up around the green economy has often been low-paying and hostile to unions.,“The president’s new mantra is ‘Build Back Better’ with good union jobs that have good wages, and not just wages but representation,” said Joe Davis, the state political coordinator for the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers in Michigan. “But these companies seem to be resistant to that.”,And Republicans are ready to try to win back the union votes that Mr. Trump won, then lost. “Rather than picking winners and losers with pie-the-sky Green New Deal mandates, we should be embracing an all-the-above energy strategy,” Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers, Republican of Washington, said Wednesday.,No industry may have more to gain — or lose — from Mr. Biden’s climate plan than America’s automakers, which currently employ about a million workers. The president’s infrastructure plan proposes $174 billion to encourage the manufacture and purchase of electric cars, which today make up just 2 percent of the vehicles on America’s highways.,He envisions a not-too-distant future in which nearly half of the middle-class drives affordable union-made cars, trucks and sport utility vehicles that produce zero fossil-fuel pollution, powered by millions of electric vehicle charging stations, all jump-started by his stimulus spending.,From a climate perspective, the plan makes sense. Fossil fuel emissions from vehicle tailpipes are the leading cause of planet-warming pollution in United States. Replacing gas-guzzlers on the road with electric vehicles could be one of the most effective ways to lower the nation’s emissions.,From a job-creation perspective, it’s more complicated. On the one hand, it takes about one-third fewer workers to build an electric car than a car with an internal combustion engine. On the other, the plan could make Detroit more competitive and increase its share of the global automobile market.,Mr. Biden’s proposed solution is to lure the electric-battery industry, and its supply chain, to the United States from China and elsewhere in Asia, with a mix of manufacturing tax credits and other incentives. If it works, the next two years would see new electric vehicle battery and assembly plants sprouting up across the country. If it fails, Mr. Biden could face harsh political repercussions.,“We can make it work, but we have to be intentional about policy to bring the battery supply chain back to the U.S.,” said Representative Debbie Dingell, a Democrat whose Detroit-area district is home to some of the nation’s largest auto plants. She added, “If they’re in China and Asia, this isn’t going to be OK.”,Some industry analysts say as Americans buy more electric vehicles, battery manufacturers will build plants in the United States. That would make it easier to integrate the batteries into cars and helps save on transportation costs.,But even with new plants much of the work can happen outside of the United States. According to a , by the Center for Strategic and International Studies and BloombergNEF, an energy research group, only 46 percent of the value of a Tesla battery assembled in the United States comes from this country. The rest comes from Japan and China.,Mr. Biden’s energy plan would also dedicate $100 billion to update and modernize the electricity grid to make it more reliable and better able to route power from wind and solar plants to large cities. Mr. Biden would also extend tax credits that subsidize investments in wind and solar energy.,Accelerating the shift to wind and solar power is likely to create tens of thousands of construction jobs, economists and industry officials say. But those jobs typically pay far less than those in the fossil fuel industry.,Anthony Prisco, the head of the renewable energy practice for the staffing firm Aerotek, said a standard solar project will employ about 250 workers for just under a year. About one-third of the workers,make $30 an hour or more; the other two-thirds have fewer skills and make hourly wages of less than $20.,By contrast, the construction of a gas-powered electricity plant typically lasts two to three years and employs hundreds of skilled, unionized tradesmen — electricians, pipe-fitters and boilermakers — who make $75,000 a year or more, including benefits.,“When you’re talking about the transition to the new green economy, the first question has got to be how are people going to make a horizontal economic move,” said Sean McGarvey, the president of North America’s Building Trades Unions, in an interview last month. “I can tell you that in the onshore wind and solar industry, for my members we’re talking in some cases a 75 percent pay cut and they’re losing benefits.”,Jim Harrison, the director of renewable energy for the Utility Workers Union of America, said that it typically takes hundreds of workers to operate and maintain a nuclear or coal plant, several dozen at a gas plant — and about a dozen at a wind farm. Solar fields can often operate without a single worker on-site.,Mr. Biden has acknowledged that his plans could leave around 130,000 oil, gas and coal workers without their livelihoods. He included a $16 billion program to help fossil fuel workers transition to new work like capping leaks on defunct oil wells and shutting down retired coal mines.,The fossil fuel industry, while generally supportive of capping abandoned wells, contends that Mr. Biden is overstating the job opportunities.,“It’s something oil and gas workers could do. They’re already experts at it, and they would be union jobs,” said Frank Maisano, a partner at Bracewell, LLP, which represents oil and gas companies. “But there are a lot of oil and gas workers, and there aren’t enough of those wells.,Still, whatever their concerns, union officials have , about the Biden plan, particularly its large investment in traditional infrastructure like roads and bridges. “These investments can restore our economic well-being and create hundreds of thousands of good union jobs,” said Terry O’Sullivan, president of the Laborers' International Union of North America, in a statement.,In Pittsburgh, a former steel town that has transformed into a hub for high tech and medicine, leaders have made clear they support clean energy development. But in other parts of Western Pennsylvania, union workers closely tied to fossil fuel industries had reservations.,“I don’t see solar or wind creating as many jobs as we get from petrochemical plants, cryogenic plants or coal fired power plants,” said Kenneth Broadbent, business manager of the Steamfitters Local 449 in Pittsburgh, who endorsed President Biden.,“There’s no stopping electric cars,” Mr. Broadbent said. But, he added, “You’re not going to see natural gas and coal and nuclear be phased out as quickly as people would like.”,A , under construction in Beaver County, northwest of Pittsburgh, employs 2,700 workers from the steamfitters union. Mr. Biden’s plan, if passed, may create jobs, Mr. Broadbent said, but it won’t be a “godsend” like the petrochemical industry has been.",business
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/business/biden-electric-vehicles-infrastructure.html,"Biden’s Push for Electric Cars: $174 Billion, 10 Years and a Bit of Luck","President Biden is a muscle-car guy — one of his , that he got from his father. But he’s trying to make this an electric vehicle world.,The , that he , is aimed at tackling climate change in part by spending up to $174 billion to encourage Americans to switch to cars and trucks that run on electricity, not gasoline or diesel. That is a large investment but it might not be enough to push most Americans toward E.V.s.,Despite rapid growth in recent years, electric vehicles remain a niche product, making up just 2 percent of the new car market and 1 percent of all cars, sport-utility vehicles, vans and pickup trucks on the road. They have been slow to take off in large part because they can cost up to $10,000 more than similar conventional cars and trucks. Charging E.V.s is also more difficult and slower than simply refilling the tank at far more prevalent gas stations.,Mr. Biden hopes to address many of those challenges through federal largess. He aims to lower the cost of electric vehicles by offering individuals, businesses and governments tax credits, rebates and other incentives. To address the chicken-and-egg problem of getting people to try a new technology before it is widely accepted, he hopes to build half a million chargers by 2030 so people will feel confident that they won’t be stranded when they run out of juice. And he is offering help to automakers to get them to build electric vehicles and batteries in the United States.,“We find ourselves at a unique moment here where most American businesses and many states are looking toward a decarbonized future, but recognize there’s a big lift on the infrastructure side,” said Bob Perciasepe, president of the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, an environmental research group. “This investment alone obviously won’t solve the climate problem or fix all of the infrastructure in the United States but it will be a huge boost.”,Automakers see the writing on the wall and many, including ,. But even they acknowledge that they will need federal help.,“This transformation is greater than any one policy, branch or level of government, or industry sector,” a group representing ,. “It will require a sustained holistic approach with a broad range of legislative and regulatory policies rooted in economic, social, environmental and cultural realities.”,The letter called for grants, loans, tax credits and tax deductions to promote research and manufacturing. The authors of the letter, which included industry groups and the United Auto Workers union, called for investment in job training programs and federal help in promoting development of minerals and other raw materials in the United States.,But production is only one piece of the puzzle. The transition away from gas-powered vehicles rests on convincing consumers of the benefits of electric vehicles. That hasn’t been easy because the cars have higher sticker prices even though researchers say that they cost less to own. Electricity is cheaper on a per mile basis than gasoline, and E.V.s require less routine maintenance — there is no oil to change — than combustion-engine cars.,The single biggest cost of an electric car comes from the battery, which can run about $15,000 for a midsize sedan. That cost has been dropping and is widely expected to keep falling thanks to manufacturing improvements and technical advancements. But some scholars believe that a major technological breakthrough will be required to make electric cars much, much cheaper.,“There’s a good sense that at least for the next maybe five years or so they’re going to keep declining, but then are they going to level off or are they going to keep declining?” Joshua Linn, a professor at the University of Maryland and a senior fellow with Resources for the Future, an environmental nonprofit, said about battery costs. “That won’t be enough, so then that’s given rise to a lot of attention to infrastructure.”,The federal government and some states already offer tax credits and other incentives for the purchase of electric cars. But the main such federal incentive — a $7,500 tax credit for the purchase of new electric cars — begins to phase out for cars once an automaker has sold 200,000 E.V.s. Buyers of Tesla and G.M. electric cars, for example, no longer qualify for that tax credit but buyers of Ford and Volkswagen electric cars do.,Mr. Biden described his incentives for electric car purchases as rebates available at the “point of sale,” presumably meaning at dealerships or while ordering cars online. But the administration has not released details about how big those rebates will be and which vehicles they would apply to.,Another big concern is charging. People with dedicated parking spots typically charge their E.V.s overnight at home, but many people who live in apartments or have to drive longer distances need to use public charging stations, which are still greatly outnumbered by gas stations.,“The top three reasons consumers give for not buying E.V.s are lack of charging stations, time to charge, and the cost of E.V.s,” said Sam Abuelsamid, an analyst at Guidehouse Insights. “They seem to be really emphasizing all three. So, over all, it looks very promising.”,There are ,, most with multiple pumps. Mr. Biden’s plan calls for a national network of 500,000 electric vehicle chargers within the decade, up from , with more than 100,000 outlets today, according to the Energy Department.,“One of the things that needs to be addressed is getting chargers into places where people only have on-street parking, like in cities and urban areas where you don’t have a driveway or garage,” Mr. Abuelsamid said. “If they can address that, it will make E.V.s available to a lot more people.”,The government in China, which leads the world in the use of electric cars, has done much more than the United States to speed up the installation of chargers.,“It is, famously, one of the ways that China has become the No. 1 country in E.V.s on most dimensions,” John Paul MacDuffie, a professor of management at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, said in an email.,Even with incentives for manufacturers, a robust charging network and a willing public, the transition to electric cars may take a few decades. Carmakers have improved vehicle reliability in recent years, so many cars stay on the road a long time.

Weisselberg, in what appears to be a determined effort to gain his cooperation. Mr. Weisselberg, who has not been accused of wrongdoing, has overseen the Trump Organization’s finances for decades and may hold the key to any possible criminal case in New York against the former president and his family business.,Prosecutors working for the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., are examining, among other things, whether Mr. Trump and the company falsely manipulated property values to obtain loans and tax benefits.,It is unclear whether Mr. Weisselberg would cooperate with the investigation and neither his lawyer, Mary E. Mulligan, nor Mr. Vance’s office would comment. But if a review of his personal finances were to uncover possible wrongdoing, prosecutors could then use that information to press Mr. Weisselberg to guide them through the inner workings of the company. The 73-year-old accountant began his career working for Mr. Trump’s father.,Separately, the prosecutors are also seeking a new round of internal documents from the Trump Organization, including general ledgers from several of its more than two dozen properties that the company did not turn over last year, according to the people with knowledge of the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive details.,The ledgers offer a line-by-line breakdown of each property’s financial situation, including daily receipts, checks and revenues. The prosecutors could compare those details against the information the company provided to its lenders and local tax authorities to assess whether it fraudulently misled them.,Mr. Vance’s office has also subpoenaed records from several banks where Mr. Trump or his company had accounts, including JPMorgan Chase and Capital One, according to people with knowledge of subpoenas served on the banks.,The previously unreported developments underscore the escalation of the investigation after Mr. Vance’s office obtained Mr. Trump’s tax records and other underlying financial documents in February. They were released over Mr. Trump’s objections after a lengthy legal battle that culminated in a ,.,The Trump Organization declined to comment. In the past, Mr. Trump, a Republican, has denied any wrongdoing and has slammed the investigation as a long-running and politically motivated “fishing expedition.” Mr. Vance, a Democrat, recently announced that ,.,The investigation has centered on some of Mr. Trump’s most prominent properties: Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, the Trump hotels in New York and Chicago and the ,. In addition to possible tax- and bank-related fraud, the prosecutors are examining the Trump Organization’s statements to insurance companies about the value of various assets.,Prosecutors have subpoenaed records from a firm hired by Deutsche Bank, one of the former president’s main lenders, to assess the value of three Trump hotels with Deutsche Bank loans, people with knowledge of the matter said. The firm reviewed the operations of restaurants, bars and gift shops at the hotels, one of the people said.,Last year, the prosecutors , Deutsche Bank itself and Mr. Trump’s other main lender, Ladder Capital, which sold its Trump Organization loans years ago. Both banks are cooperating with the prosecutors.,It is unclear whether the prosecutors will ultimately file any charges. But if a case were built against the Trump Organization based on the loan documents, the company’s lawyers could argue that Deutsche Bank and Ladder Capital are sophisticated financial institutions that conducted their own analysis of Mr. Trump’s properties without relying on the company’s internal assessments. The lawyers could also emphasize that providing different valuations for a property depending on the situation — for example, on a loan application or in appealing local property taxes — is common and appropriate in New York’s real estate industry, in part because there are varying methods for calculating property values.,Outside accountants also vet the information provided to local tax authorities, potentially reducing the likelihood of fraud. Mr. Trump has argued that his tax returns “were done by among the biggest and most prestigious law and accounting firms in the U.S.”,In addition to the fraud investigation, Mr. Vance’s office continues to focus on its original target: the Trump Organization’s role in paying hush money during the 2016 presidential campaign to two women who said they had affairs with Mr. Trump.,Mr. Trump’s former personal lawyer and fixer, Michael D. Cohen, paid $130,000 to buy the silence of one of the women, Stephanie Clifford, the pornographic film actress who performed as Stormy Daniels. The Trump Organization later reimbursed Mr. Cohen, and Mr. Vance’s office has scrutinized whether the company properly accounted for the $130,000 payment.,Mr. Cohen, who in 2018 pleaded guilty to federal campaign finance charges for his role in the hush-money scheme, has long implicated Mr. Weisselberg, alleging that he helped devise a strategy to mask the reimbursements. The federal prosecutors who charged Mr. Cohen did not accuse Mr. Weisselberg of wrongdoing.,Mr. Cohen is now cooperating with Mr. Vance’s investigation and has met with prosecutors several times, including to review some of Mr. Trump’s financial documents. Lanny Davis, a lawyer for Mr. Cohen, declined to comment.,The prosecutors have also questioned Mr. Weisselberg’s former daughter-in-law, Jennifer Weisselberg, she has said. Ms. Weisselberg has been enmeshed in a bitter divorce with Mr. Weisselberg’s son, Barry, who manages the Trump Wollman Rink in Central Park.,Ms. Weisselberg said in an interview that prosecutors have asked her about a number of gifts that Mr. Trump and his company gave the Weisselberg family over the years. These include an apartment on Central Park South for Ms. Weisselberg and her former husband, cars leased for several family members and private school tuition.,The scrutiny of the gifts appears to be part of an effort to paint a picture of Mr. Weisselberg’s financial life, as is common when prosecutors seek cooperation from a potential witness. It is unclear whether prosecutors suspect any wrongdoing related to the gifts.,James B. Stewart, and ,Steve Eder, contributed reporting. ,Susan C. Beachy, contributed research.",business
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/health/esophageal-cancer-nivolumab.html,A ‘Game Changer’ for Patients With Esophageal Cancer,"For decades, esophageal cancer has defied scientific attempts to discover a therapy that extends patients’ survival, year after year claiming the lives of such illustrious people as Humphrey Bogart, Christopher Hitchens and Ann Richards, the former governor of Texas.,Now a , offers hope, finding that a drug that unleashes the immune system to attack cancer cells can double the disease-free survival times in patients from 11 months to 22 months. The study was published on Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine.,“It is a game changer,” said Dr. David Ilson, an esophageal cancer expert at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, who wrote , accompanying the research. “We’ve waited a long time for this.”,In the trial, sponsored by Bristol-Myers Squibb, 794 patients in 29 countries were randomly assigned to receive infusions of the drug, nivolumab, or a placebo.,The patients had all had chemotherapy and radiation followed by surgery to remove their cancers. As usually happens, pathology reports showed that the surgery did not remove all of the cancer cells, which still lurked in lymph nodes and elsewhere, setting the stage in these patients for their cancers to return as incurable metastases.,Nivolumab is approved for some patients with other cancers, like Hodgkin’s lymphoma, melanoma and colorectal cancer. With the new study, experts expect the drug will readily win approval for treatment of early-stage esophageal cancer.,Dr. Ronan Kelly, director of the Charles A. Sammons Cancer Center at Baylor University Medical Center and lead author of the new study, said he and the other researchers urgently wanted to help the 75 percent of patients who go through extraordinarily difficult sequences of radiation, chemotherapy and surgery that disfigures the digestive system, only to learn that cancer is still present or has a high likelihood of recurring.,Without some other form of treatment, “we knew many would recur quickly,” Dr. Kelly said. Additional chemotherapy not only was difficult for patients to tolerate, but it also did not seem to help. Nivolumab has few side effects and seemed worth a try.,Esophageal cancer is rare in the United States, accounting for 1 percent of all cancers; about 15,000 patients die each year. But it is the seventh most common cancer globally, and frequently seen in East Asia, although it is not clear why, Dr. Ilson said.,Smoking is a risk factor, but researchers do not think the high smoking rates in China, for example, explain the high incidence. “We don’t think it’s environmental,” Dr. Ilson said.,Other risk factors include alcohol consumption and acid reflux disease.,Because the cancer is so rare in the United States, it has not gotten much research attention. While new treatments have revolutionized prospects for other cancer patients, those with esophageal cancer could only look on longingly.,That has weighed heavily on people with the disease, said Mindy Mordecai. Her husband, John, died of esophageal cancer in March 2008. She started an advocacy group called Esophageal Cancer Action Network.,“You can’t even imagine how demoralizing it is to see all the progress around you. ‘Please sir, may I have some more gruel?’” she said, quoting Oliver Twist, the Charles Dickens character in the eponymous novel, asking for a pittance.,The new findings must be seen in the context of what patients go through when they develop esophageal cancer, experts said. Most learn they have the cancer after it has progressed to a point where they are unlikely to survive.,But every patient hopes to be one of the lucky ones. “Our patients are always waiting for the other shoe to drop,” Ms. Mordecai said. “You have to understand what it’s like to live with that every day.”,The first step for most is chemotherapy and radiation. The treatment is so harsh that an oncology nurse told Mr. Mordecai it “brings Navy Seals to their knees,” Ms. Mordecai recalled.,The chemotherapy has difficult side effects, and the radiation causes a burning sensation that makes it difficult to swallow. “Food won’t go down,” Ms. Mordecai said. “You just feel rotten.”,The next step is major surgery. A doctor takes out most of the patient’s esophagus, the tract leading from the mouth to the stomach, and then grabs the stomach and pulls it up, attaching it to a stump of esophagus left behind.,The result is a stomach that is vertical, not horizontal, and lacks the sphincter muscle that normally keeps stomach acid from spilling out. For the rest of their lives, patients can never lie flat — if they do, the contents of their stomach, including acid, pours into their throats. They can choke, cough and aspirate.,Recovery is difficult, and morbidity and mortality are high. But most patients go through with the operation once they weigh their options. To refuse the treatment means giving up and letting the cancer close off the esophagus to the point where some cannot even swallow their own saliva, said Dr. Paul Helft, a professor of surgery and an ethicist at Indiana University School of Medicine.,The treatment is so long and harrowing that Dr. Helft often uses it to teach medical students and other trainees about informed consent — about how patients must be fully informed before they start any given treatment. Esophageal cancer patients in particular must be told that they are likely to have a recurrence within the first year.,Ms. Mordecai said her husband had his surgery at the end of September 2008. By Dec. 6, he had untreatable metastases in his liver. Now, she said, patients may have a glimmer of hope.,Dr. Ilson, who has spent his career trying to develop therapies to help patients with esophageal cancer, said that he did not expect this treatment to succeed: “We all get nihilistic when faced with years of negative studies.”,“This is really a landmark paper,” he added, and the drug “will become a new standard of care.”",business

The plans include raising the corporate tax rate to 28 percent from 21 percent. The corporate tax rate had been cut from 35 percent under former President Donald J. Trump.,The Business Roundtable said it supported infrastructure investment, calling it “essential to economic growth” and important “to ensure a rapid economic recovery” — but rejected corporate tax increases as a way to pay for it.,Policymakers should avoid creating new barriers to job creation and economic growth, particularly during the recovery,” the group’s chief executive, Joshua Bolten, ,.,The U.S. Chamber of Commerce echoed that view. “We strongly oppose the general tax increases proposed by the administration, which will slow the economic recovery and make the U.S. less competitive globally — the exact opposite of the goals of the infrastructure plan,” the chamber’s chief policy officer, Neil Bradley, ,.,The president’s focus on the work force will help the economy as it recovers from the pandemic-induced slowdown, the National Association of Manufacturers, a trade group, said in a statement. But, it added, the proposed tax increase would hurt the country’s competitive advantage.,“Raising taxes on manufacturers would fundamentally undermine our ability to lead this recovery,” the trade group said., since the presidential election and has hoped that gridlock in Washington would moderate Mr. Biden’s agenda. On Wednesday, a spokesman for JPMorgan Chase said the bank’s chief executive, Jamie Dimon, believed “that the corporate tax rate for companies in the U.S. has to be competitive globally, which it is now.”,But “he has no problem with high-income people like himself paying a higher tax rate,” said the spokesman, Joseph Evangelisti.,The Biden administration has indicated that , for wealthy Americans will help fund the second phase of the infrastructure plan, which is expected to be announced next month and will focus on priorities like education, health care and paid leave. The increase in corporate taxes is an effort to “ensure that corporations pay their fair share,” White House officials said ,.",business
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/technology/turing-award-aho-ullman.html,Turing Award Goes to Creators of Computer Programming Building Blocks,"When Alfred Aho and Jeffrey Ullman met while waiting in the registration line on their first day of graduate school at Princeton University in 1963, computer science was still a strange new world.,Using a computer required a set of esoteric skills typically reserved for trained engineers and mathematicians. But today, thanks in part to the work of Dr. Aho and Dr. Ullman, practically anyone can use a computer and program it to perform new tasks.,On Wednesday, the Association for Computing Machinery, the world’s largest society of computing professionals, said Dr. Aho and Dr. Ullman would receive this year’s Turing Award for their work on the fundamental concepts that underpin computer programming languages. Given since 1966 and often called the Nobel Prize of computing, the Turing Award comes with a $1 million prize, which the two academics and longtime friends will split.,Dr. Aho and Dr. Ullman helped refine one of the key components of a computer: the “compiler” that ,.,Over the past five decades, computer scientists have built increasingly intuitive programming languages, making it easier and easier for people to create software for desktops, laptops, smartphones, cars and even supercomputers. Compilers ensure that these languages are efficiently translated into the ones and zeros that computers understand.,Without their work, “we would not be able to write an app for our phones,” said Krysta Svore, a researcher at Microsoft who studied with Dr. Aho at Columbia University, where he was chairman of the computer science department. “We would not have the cars we drive these days.”,The researchers also wrote many textbooks and taught generations of students as they defined how computer software development was different from electrical engineering or mathematics.,“Their fingerprints are all over the field,” said Graydon Hoare, the creator of a programming language called Rust. He added that two of Dr. Ullman’s books were sitting on the shelf beside him.,After leaving Princeton, both Dr. Aho, a Canadian by birth who is 79, and Dr. Ullman, a native New Yorker who is 78, joined the New Jersey headquarters of Bell Labs, which was then one of the world’s leading research labs.,Dr. Ullman, now professor emeritus at Stanford University, was also instrumental in developing the languages and concepts that drive databases, the software for storing and retrieving information that is essential to everything from the Google search engine to the applications used by office workers across the globe.,The ideas cultivated by Dr. Aho and Dr. Ullman are even a part of the computers of the future. At Microsoft, Dr. Svore is working on quantum computers, experimental machines that , exhibited by things like electrons or exotic metals cooled to several hundred degrees below zero.,Quantum computers rely on a completely different kind of physical behavior from traditional computers. But as they create programming languages for these machines, Dr. Svore and her colleagues are still drawing on the work of the latest Turing winners.,“We are building on the same techniques,” she said.",business
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/business/voting-rights-georgia-corporations.html,Black Executives Call on Corporations to Fight Restrictive Voting Laws,"Dozens of the most prominent Black business leaders in America are banding together to call on companies to fight a wave of restrictive voting bills being advanced by Republicans in at least 43 states. The campaign appears to be the first time that so many powerful Black executives have organized to directly call out their peers for failing to stand up for racial justice.,The effort, led by Kenneth Chenault, a former chief executive of American Express, and Kenneth Frazier, the chief executive of Merck, is a response to the swift passage of a Georgia law that they contend makes it harder for Black people to vote. As the debate about that bill raged in recent weeks, most major corporations — including those with headquarters in Atlanta — did not take a position on the legislation.,“There is no middle ground here,” Mr. Chenault said. “You either are for more people voting, or you want to suppress the vote.”,The executives did not criticize specific companies, but instead called on all of corporate America to publicly and directly oppose new laws that would restrict the rights of Black voters, and to use their clout, money and lobbyists to sway the debate with lawmakers.,“This impacts all Americans, but we also need to acknowledge the history of voting rights for African-Americans,” Mr. Chenault said. “And as African-American executives in corporate America, what we were saying is we want corporate America to understand that, and we want them to work with us.”,The letter was signed by 72 Black executives. They included Roger Ferguson Jr., the chief executive of TIAA; Mellody Hobson and John Rogers Jr., the co-chief executives of Ariel Investments; Robert F. Smith, the chief executive of Vista Equity Partners; and Raymond McGuire, a former Citigroup executive who is running for mayor of New York.,In the days before the Georgia law was passed, , spoke out against the legislation, which introduced stricter voter identification requirements for absentee balloting, limited drop boxes and expanded the legislature’s power over elections.,Big corporations based in Atlanta, including Delta Air Lines, Coca-Cola and Home Depot, offered general statements of support for voting rights, but none took a specific stance on the bills. The same was true for most of the executives who signed the new letter, including Mr. Frazier and Mr. Chenault.,Mr. Frazier said he had paid only peripheral attention to the matter before the Georgia law was passed on Thursday. “When the law passed, I started paying attention,” he said.,When Mr. Frazier realized what was in the new law, and that similar bills were being advanced in other states, he and Mr. Chenault decided to take action. On Sunday, they began emailing and texting with a group of Black executives, discussing what more corporations could do.,“There seems to be no one speaking out,” Mr. Frazier said. “We thought if we spoke up, it might lead to a situation where others felt the responsibility to speak up.”,Among the other executives who signed the letter were Ursula Burns, a former chief executive of Xerox; Richard Parsons, a former chairman of Citigroup and chief executive of Time Warner; and Tony West, the chief legal officer at Uber. The group of leaders, with support from the Black Economic Alliance, bought a full-page ad in the Wednesday print edition of The New York Times.,The executives are hoping that big companies will help prevent dozens of similar bills in other states from becoming law.,“The Georgia legislature was the first one,” Mr. Frazier said. “If corporate America doesn’t stand up, we’ll get these laws passed in many places in this country.”,In 2017, Mr. Frazier was the first chief executive to publicly resign from President Donald J. Trump’s business advisory councils after the president’s equivocating response to white nationalist violence in Charlottesville, Va. His , led other chief executives to distance themselves from Mr. Trump, and the advisory groups disbanded.,“As African-American business executives, we don’t have the luxury of being bystanders to injustice,” Mr. Frazier said. “We don’t have the luxury of sitting on the sidelines when these kinds of injustices are happening all around us.”,Companies have taken stands on state legislation in recent years, often to powerful effect. In 2016 and 2017, as conservatives advanced so-called bathroom bills in states including Indiana, North Carolina, Georgia and Texas, big companies went so far as to threaten to take their business elsewhere if the laws were enacted. Those bills were never signed into law.,Last year, the Human Rights Campaign began persuading companies to sign on to , that states their “clear opposition to harmful legislation aimed at restricting the access of L.G.B.T.Q. people in society.” Dozens of major companies, including AT&T, Facebook, Nike and Pfizer, signed on.,To Mr. Chenault, the contrast between the business community’s response to that issue and to voting restrictions that disproportionately harm Black voters was telling.,“You had 60 major companies — Amazon, Google, American Airlines — that signed on to the statement that states a very clear opposition to harmful legislation aimed at restricting the access of L.G.B.T.Q. people in society,” he said. “So, you know, it is bizarre that we don’t have companies standing up to this.”,“This is not new,” Mr. Chenault added. “When it comes to race, there’s differential treatment. That’s the reality.”,Activists are now calling for boycotts of Delta and Coca-Cola for their tepid engagement before the Georgia law was passed. And there are signs that other companies and sports leagues are becoming more engaged with the issue.,The head of the Major League Baseball Players Association said he , to a discussion about moving the All-Star Game from Atlanta, where it is planned for July. And Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, released a statement on Tuesday affirming his company’s commitment to voting rights.,“Voting is fundamental to the health and future of our democracy,” he said. “We regularly encourage our employees to exercise their fundamental right to vote, and we stand against efforts that may prevent them from being able to do so.”,That language echoed statements made by many big companies before the Georgia law was passed. The executives who signed the letter are likely to seek more.,“People ask, ‘What can I do?’” Mr. Chenault said. “I’ll tell you what you can do. You can publicly oppose any discriminatory legislation and all measures designed to limit Americans’ ability to vote.”",business
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/30/business/office-return-space.html,Here Come Hot Desks and Zoom Rooms. And Holograms?,"Since the pandemic sent workers home last year, a slew of modifications have been made to office buildings to protect against the spread of the coronavirus. Now, as companies prepare to bring workers back, experts say even more changes are on the way.,Expect expanded gathering spaces and fewer personal workstations, for instance, changes that are being fueled by the success of working from home. Companies like ,, , and , have already announced proposals for hybrid work models that will allow employees to continue to work remotely at least a few days a week.,These new arrangements mean companies may need less office space, and some have already cut back on their real estate needs, according to ,. , said this month that it was giving up office space in downtown Minneapolis, and in September, the sporting goods retailer , in Bellevue, Wash.,“We really are at an inflection point,” said Meena Krenek, an interior design director at Perkins+Will, an architecture firm that is revamping offices, including its own, for new modes of working.,Last spring, while lockdowns were in place, landlords and tenants prepared for what they thought would be ,. Desks were dragged six feet apart and Plexiglas ,. One-way arrows were stenciled on corridor floors, chairs were removed from conference rooms, and an elaborate choreography was developed to determine how and when teams would return to avoid overcrowding.,Then many workers simply stayed home. As the pandemic dragged on and people got the hang of Zoom, many discovered it was possible to be productive while parked on living room sofas or in backyard lawn chairs.,Now, as company heads , to the office, not only safety measures but also the new work arrangements are driving discussions about the postpandemic workplace. More than 80 percent of companies are embracing a hybrid model whereby ,, according to a new survey by KayoCloud, a real estate technology platform.,Workplaces are being reimagined for activities benefiting from face-to-face interaction, including collaboration on projects and employee training, as a way to promote a company’s culture and identity.,Common areas will be increased and equipped with furniture that can be moved as needs change. Steelcase and Knoll, suppliers of office furniture, report strong interest in mobile tables, carts and partitions.,But as the amount of space devoted to gathering expands, the fate of one’s own personal turf at the office — a desk decorated with family photos, a couple of file cabinets — hangs in the balance. Why, company leaders are asking, should someone who is in the office one or two days a week require a space that will sit empty the rest of the time?,In some cases, personal desks are being replaced with “hoteling” workstations, also called hot desks, which can be used by whoever needs a place to touch down for a day.,In the early months of the pandemic, when it was believed that the coronavirus was spread via contaminated surfaces, hot desks got a hard no from office users. But that stance has softened with the recognition that the virus is transmitted mainly through the air. Protocols for wiping down tabletops before and after use have become the norm. So has reserving a hot desk ahead of time rather than simply showing up and grabbing a free spot.,Workers have often resisted the loss of their personal desks when companies sought to reduce their real estate footprint, but they may be more amenable to the idea now if the payoff is the ability to skip the commute and work from home.,“A year ago, if I had interviewed people, they would have said they definitely need three file cabinets and a bookshelf,” said Andrea Vanecko, a principal at the architecture firm NBBJ. “Now there’s a very different answer.”,Conference rooms, too, are getting a reboot. In the past, these rooms were predicated on the idea of people gathering in person. A large screen on a wall might be used for presentations or to let an executive in another location make a cameo appearance.,But some employees are permanently moving to remote work, and companies are puzzling over how to give them the same ability to participate as those who are physically present. There are even early discussions about using artificial intelligence to conjure up , of employees who are off site but could still ,.,For now, some companies are having in-person attendees continue to use their laptops so that remote workers can see everyone on their Zoom screens, an effort to “help maintain a sense of equivalency that we’ve come to expect,” said Peter Knutson, chief strategy officer of A+I, a design firm.,Devices combining 360-degree cameras, microphones and speakers are being placed on a table or tripod to improve sound and visibility. In the future, these technologies are likely to be built into gathering places and the number of screens increased, transforming the conference room into a “Zoom room,” Ms. Krenek said.,Likewise, some phone booths — the closet-size pods deployed in open-plan offices to give workers a place to make private calls — may give way to videoconferencing booths, which ,.,Screens are destined to pop up elsewhere. One near the coffee bar or at a cafe table could allow those on the premises to meet virtually for a latte or lunch with colleagues working remotely.,And digital whiteboards are likely to become more popular, so workers at home can see what’s being written in real time.,Modifications made to offices to protect against the coronavirus are still in effect. Stopgap measures may fade away as the pandemic loosens its grip, but others will be here to stay.,In lobbies, floor decals spaced six feet apart may be around “just until people get into the habit,” said Natalie Engels, a principal at Gensler, an architecture firm. Signs that had proliferated during the pandemic — promoting “self-cleaning” elevator buttons and virus-zapping technologies like ionization and ultraviolet light — will eventually be removed.,But increasingly, moving through an office building is likely to be a hands-free experience aided by mobile apps, sensors and voice controls, even after the reluctance to touch surfaces diminishes.,Sensors will allow employees to enter a turnstile and summon an elevator with the wave of a hand. Landlords who have yet to invest in such systems have experimented with ,. Buttons on walls outside restrooms can be pressed with an elbow, averting the need to touch door handles. Some companies are adding ,.,The coronavirus has focused attention on air quality in what may be a lasting way. , before the pandemic and have become more so as fresh air has gone from being a nicety to being a necessity.,Landlords have in some cases adjusted HVAC systems to increase the amount of outdoor air being pumped in. They are also upgrading filters to trap smaller airborne particles.,Some measures are being enshrined in leases, said Geoffrey F. Fay, a real estate lawyer with Pullman & Comley. But landlords are doing such things proactively, he added, as they try to make offices as enticing as possible at a time when tenants may be wondering if they even need to rent space anymore.,“Landlords realize we are on the precipice of change,” he said. “They want to make employees feel comfortable to the extent they’re coming back to the office.”",business
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/30/business/grocery-retail-mask-mandates.html,"As Mask Mandates Lift, Retail Workers Again Feel Vulnerable","Marilyn Reece, the lead bakery clerk at a Kroger in Batesville, Miss., started noticing more customers walking around the store without masks this month after the state mandate to wear face coverings was repealed. Kroger still requires them, but that doesn’t seem to matter.,When Ms. Reece, a 56-year-old breast-cancer survivor, sees those shoppers, she prays. “Please, please, don’t let me have to wait on them, because in my heart, I don’t want to ignore them, I don’t want to refuse them,” she said. “But then I’m thinking I don’t want to get sick and die, either. It’s not that people are bad, but you don’t know who they’ve come into contact with.”,Ms. Reece’s heightened anxiety is shared by retail and fast-food workers in states like Mississippi and Texas, where governments have removed , before a majority of people have been vaccinated and while troubling new variants of the coronavirus are appearing. It feels like a return to the early days of the pandemic, when businesses said customers must wear masks but there was no legal requirement and numerous shoppers simply refused. Many workers say that their stores do not enforce the requirement, and that if they do approach customers, they risk verbal or physical altercations.,“It’s given a great false sense of security, and it’s no different now than it was a year ago,” said Ms. Reece, who is not yet able to receive a vaccine because of allergies. “The only difference we have now is people are getting vaccinated but enough people haven’t gotten vaccinated that they should have lifted the mandate.”,For many people who work in retail, especially grocery stores and big-box chains, the mask repeals are another example of how little protection and appreciation they have received during the pandemic. While they were praised as essential workers, that rarely , on top of their low wages. Grocery employees were not initially given priority for vaccinations in ,, even as health experts cautioned the public to limit time in grocery stores because of the risk posed by new coronavirus variants. (Texas opened availability to everyone 16 and older on Monday.),The issue has gained serious prominence: On Monday, President Biden called on governors and mayors to , as the nation grapples with a potential rise in virus cases.,The United Food and Commercial Workers union, which represents nearly 900,000 grocery workers, said this month that at least 34,700 grocery workers around the country had been infected with or exposed to Covid-19 and that at least 155 workers had died from the virus. The recent mass shooting at a ,, has only rattled workers further and added to concerns about their own safety.,Diane Cambre, a 50-year-old floor supervisor at a Kroger in Midlothian, Texas, said she had spent much of the past year worrying about bringing the virus home to her 9-year-old son and dreading interactions with customers who were flippant about the possibility of getting sick. She wears a double mask in the store even though it irritates her skin, already itchy from psoriasis, and changes her clothes as soon as she gets home.,After Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas said on March 2 that he would , the next week, Ms. Cambre said, customers immediately “started coming in not wearing a mask and stuff, and it’s been pretty hard getting anybody to wear one.” Management is supposed to offer masks to people who aren’t wearing them, but if they don’t put them on, nothing else is done, she said.,Asking customers to wear masks can result in tense exchanges and even ,.,“Some of our customers are drama-prone, so they’ll start yelling, ‘I’m not wearing that mask,’ and you can tell they’re very rude in their voice and very harsh,” Ms. Cambre, a U.F.C.W. member, said. Overseeing the self-checkout aisles has been especially challenging, she said, because customers who need help will demand that she come over, making it impossible to maintain six feet of distance.,At times when she has tried to explain the need for distancing, “they say, ‘OK, and that’s just a government thing,’” she said. “It really takes a toll on you mentally.”,A Kroger representative said that the chain would “continue to require everyone in our stores across the country to wear masks until all our frontline grocery associates can receive the Covid-19 vaccine,” and that it was offering $100 one-time payments to workers who received the vaccine.,The differing state and business mandates have some workers worried about more ,. The retail industry was already trying to address the issue last fall, when a major trade group helped put together training to help workers manage and de-escalate conflicts with customers who resisted masks, social distancing and store capacity limits. ,, or asking them to leave, has led to incidents in the past year like a cashier’s being punched in the face, a Target employee’s breaking his arm and the fatal shooting of a ,.,This month in League City, Texas, near Houston, a 53-year-old man who , a required mask in a , confronted employees and then stabbed a store manager three times, according to a report in The Houston Chronicle.

It shouldn’t have been based on politics — it should have been based on science.”,Some Texans have started to seek out mask-friendly establishments. Ms. Kaylor said that lists of Dallas businesses that require masks had been circulating on Facebook, and that people were consulting them to figure out where to buy groceries and do other shopping.,Emily Francois, a sales associate at a Walmart in Port Arthur, Texas, said that customers had been ignoring signs to wear masks and that Walmart had not been enforcing the policy. So Ms. Francois stands six feet away from shoppers who don’t wear masks, even though that upsets some of them. “My life is more important,” she said.,“I see customers coming in without a mask and they’re coughing, sneezing, they’re not covering their mouths,” said Ms. Francois, who has worked at Walmart for 14 years and is a member of United for Respect, an advocacy group. “Customers coming in the store without masks make us feel like we aren’t worthy, we aren’t safe.”,Phillip Keene, a spokesman for Walmart, said that “our policy of requiring associates and customers to wear masks in our stores has helped protect them during the pandemic, and we’re not lifting those measures at this time.”,Even before the pandemic, Ms. Reece, the Kroger clerk in Mississippi, was wearing a mask to protect herself from the flu because of her cancer diagnosis, she said.,She said 99 percent of customers in her small store had worn masks during the pandemic. “When they had to put it on, they did put it on,” she said. “It’s like giving a child a piece of candy — that child is going to eat that candy unless you take it from them.”,She is concerned about the potential harm from new variants, particularly from those who don’t cover their mouths. “You just have to pray and pray you don’t get within six feet of them, or 10 feet for that matter,” said Ms. Reece, who is also a U.F.C.W. member and has worked for Kroger for more than 30 years. “I know people want it to be back to normal, but you can’t just will it to be back to normal.”",business

Using a simple star rating — one being the worst, five the best — the system promised to distill reams of information and transform an emotional process into one based on objective, government-blessed metrics.,The star system quickly became ubiquitous, a popular way for consumers to educate themselves and for nursing homes to attract new customers. During the coronavirus pandemic, with many locked-down homes unavailable for prospective residents or their families to see firsthand, the ratings seemed indispensable.,But a New York Times investigation, based on the most comprehensive analysis of the data that powers the ratings program, found that it is broken.,Despite ,, the system provided a badly distorted picture of the quality of care at the nation’s nursing homes. Many relied on sleight-of-hand maneuvers to improve their ratings and hide shortcomings that contributed to the damage when the pandemic struck.,More than , nursing-home residents have died of Covid-19, and The Times’s analysis found that people at five-star facilities were roughly as likely to die of the disease as those at one-star homes.,The ratings program, run by the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, relies on a mix of self-reported data from more than 15,000 nursing homes and on-site examinations by state health inspectors. Nursing homes receive scores based on how they fare in those inspections; how much time nurses spend with residents; and the quality of care that residents receive. Those three grades are then combined into an overarching star rating for each nursing home.,To evaluate the ratings’ reliability, The Times built a database to analyze millions of payroll records to determine how much hands-on care nursing homes provide residents, combed through 373,000 reports by state inspectors and examined financial statements submitted to the government by more than 10,000 nursing homes.,The Times obtained access to portions of the ratings data that aren’t publicly available from academics who had research agreements with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or C.M.S.,Among The Times’s findings:,At homes whose five stars masked serious problems, residents developed bed sores so severe that their bones were exposed. Others lost the ability to move.,But the most important impact may be that the nursing home industry was ill equipped for the pandemic. The rating system allowed facilities to score high grades without upgrading the care they provided.,“They were working to improve their ratings, but not their quality,” said Charlene Harrington, who sits on a board that advises C.M.S. on the ratings system.,“The problems with the five-star system left these homes less prepared in the pandemic,” she said. “They were allowed to not have enough staffing, and they were allowed to ignore infection-control deficiencies, so they had poorer quality than the public knew about, and they were in the worst position to manage Covid.”,Fulton Commons Care, a nursing home on Long Island, is among hundreds of facilities whose five stars reflected self-reported data that was at times inaccurate.,One of the home’s residents was Stasia Kochanowska, a 75-year-old retired nurse. Last March, her son, John Costa, got a phone call from Fulton Commons: She was being moved from a private room into one with other residents. Mr. Costa interpreted that as evidence that the home was short-staffed or overcrowded. “I thought that the idea was to isolate people to keep them safe from the virus,” he said.,Not long after, he got another call: Ms. Kochanowska had a fever. On the morning of April 10, Mr. Costa got the news he had been dreading: His mother had died from Covid-19.,“Looking back now, I realize that the star doesn’t work and shouldn’t be trusted,” Mr. Costa said. “But it’s too late.”,The star system was introduced in 2008. , were buying many nursing homes, and lawmakers worried that the quality of care would deteriorate. (Today, for-profit companies own about 70 percent of all U.S. nursing homes.),The only way to evaluate nursing homes at the time was , called Nursing Home Compare. It included tables of statistics about each nursing home. Consumers largely ignored the information.,The new system transformed hard-to-digest information on resident safety, staffing and dozens of other metrics into simple star ratings.,The rating starts with the grade from the in-person inspections and then awards bonus points for facilities that score well on the other two ratings: for staffing and their quality of care. The staffing score reflects the number of hours that employees spend with patients. The quality-of-care rating incorporates 15 metrics — such as residents’ wounds and medications — drawn from what are essentially medical report cards for every resident.,C.M.S. posts each nursing home’s overall star rating, and its ratings for inspections, staffing and quality of care, on a website called ,When the system was first rolled out, elder-care groups applauded it for providing an easy-to-understand look inside nursing homes. As it gained popularity, it became a powerful determinant of fortunes in an industry with thin profit margins.,Five-star facilities earned about $2,000 in profits per bed in 2019, according to a Times analysis of nursing homes’ financial statements. Those with three or four stars earned about $1,000 per bed. Poorly rated homes were typically not profitable.,But within months of the star system’s launch, members of a Medicare advisory board cautioned federal officials that nursing homes were incentivized to fudge their numbers, according to board members and former regulators. Board members, including Ms. Harrington, a professor emeritus at the nursing school of University of California, San Francisco, called for more auditing of the self-reported data.,Audits, however, remain rare, according to 25 former government officials, congressional aides, nursing home executives and elder-care advocates who meet regularly with C.M.S. officials.,The Times found that from 2017 to 2019 health inspectors wrote up about 5,700 nursing homes, more than one out of every three in the country, for misreporting data about residents’ well-being. That included nearly 800 homes with top ratings. Some facilities didn’t tell the government about certain medications they were giving residents. Others didn’t disclose when residents took serious falls or developed bed sores.,Even when inspectors discovered such misreporting, they didn’t conduct more detailed audits of all of the data that the homes submitted to C.M.S.,A spokeswoman for C.M.S. said in a statement that the star-rating system is “intended to serve as one tool” for people to choose nursing homes. “Overall scores should be considered in light of a potential resident’s unique care needs,” she said. (C.M.S. would not identify the spokeswoman.),C.M.S. in recent years “has made multiple substantial improvements to both the ratings methodology and data reliability of the five-star quality rating system. These improvements have made it more difficult to attain or maintain higher ratings, driving providers to continue improving the quality of care they provide,” the spokeswoman said.,She said the Department of Health and Human Services “takes reports of fraud seriously” and that “C.M.S. deploys enforcement and accountability measures swiftly if fraud is detected.”,The warnings about self-reported data have been borne out by researchers.,A , last year by Integra Med Analytics, a data firm started by a University of Texas professor, compared hospital admissions data with the information nursing homes submitted to Medicare. The paper concluded that half of nursing homes underreported potentially deadly pressure ulcers, or bed sores, by at least 50 percent.,In 2019, the , found that nursing homes reported only 16 percent of incidents where residents were hospitalized for “potential abuse and neglect.”,And researchers at the University of Chicago ,, from 2011 to 2015, nursing homes didn’t tell Medicare about 40 percent of residents who were hospitalized after serious falls.,One of the worst offenders in that study was the Clove Lakes home on Staten Island in New York, where 72 residents were admitted to a hospital after falling, but only 15 were reported to C.M.S. A Clove Lakes spokeswoman declined to comment.,Menorah Park, a facility in Beachwood, Ohio, that had five stars, disclosed only 11 of 47 serious falls.,Kathleen DeVito, a former resident at Menorah Park, said in an interview that she selected the facility based on its perfect rating. One night, she said, aides took her to the bathroom and then left her alone. She crashed to the floor while trying to wipe herself. Her ankle was shattered, her medical records show. She now has to use a walker.,“I think about how much better I’d be if I had never gone there,” said Ms. DeVito, 78, a retired paralegal.,Beth Silver, a spokeswoman for the nursing home, said, “The incidence of falls at Menorah Park is in line with other highly regarded facilities at both the state and federal levels, and are even lower for serious falls, which we attribute to our rigorous fall prevention program.”,She added, “While our sympathy goes out to anyone who may have been injured while a resident at our facility, it does not necessarily mean that the facility was at fault or could have prevented the injury.”,In 2018, C.M.S. improved the way it collected staffing data. Instead of asking nursing homes to report the average number of hours nurses and aides spent with residents, the agency required homes to submit payroll records that logged their daily hours. The hope was that such data would be harder to manipulate.,With the payroll records, nursing homes’ average staffing numbers plummeted, according to the Times analysis. That suggested that homes had previously been inflating their nursing data.,Even with the new system, many homes still appear to exaggerate how much time nurses spend with patients.,The Times analyzed the publicly available staffing logs submitted to C.M.S. Thousands of homes — including more than 450 with four or five stars for staffing — derived at least half of their nursing hours from administrators who don’t care for patients. C.M.S. permits the practice, but the public sees only the total number of hours, not the breakdown between administrative nurses and registered nurses who care for patients.,Sun Terrace Healthcare Center had a two-star rating for staffing in early 2019. Then, in the second half of the year, the home, in Sun City Center, Fla., reported a surge in its nursing hours. The bulk of that increase was from the addition of administrators to the tally. By January 2020, Sun Terrace had a five-star rating.,“The administrative nursing staff at Sun Terrace work very closely with the direct care staff in a collaborative team approach to ensure the facility provides the best possible care for each and every resident,” said Alexander J. Kusmierz, the facility’s executive director.,In light of questions from The Times, Mr. Kusmierz said, the home would audit the staffing data it has reported to C.M.S. “Sun Terrace will continue to make certain that the information provided is thorough and accurate,” he said.,Researchers have , that the better staffed a facility was, the fewer residents they lost to Covid-19. More employees meant that patients received better care and were more closely monitored. When the pandemic hit, staffing came under additional strain as nurses and workers fell ill.,Trinity Homes, a facility with 230 beds in Minot, N.D., received five stars for its staffing levels. But residents repeatedly complained to inspectors that the place was short-staffed. In 2019, half of Trinity’s nursing hours came from administrators.,More than 130 residents contracted Covid-19. Thirty-five died.,Karim Tripodina, a spokeswoman for Trinity, said the home complies with C.M.S. requirements and has “ample staff to care for our residents.” She said that Covid-19 spread inside the facility at the same time it was spreading in the local community, “despite aggressive efforts to maintain a safe environment.”,Carrie Johnson, 75, had just had spinal fusion surgery. A raw incision snaked up her back, and it needed to be cleaned regularly to prevent infection. She couldn’t control her bowels.,Using the C.M.S. website, Ms. Johnson found a nursing home, Brookdale Richmond Place, where she could recuperate. Part of the country’s largest chain of senior living communities, it was a short drive from her house in Lexington, Ky., and the only local facility with a five-star rating for staffing.,“We thought it meant that I’d be safe,” Ms. Johnson said.,That was not what it meant.,At the time, in October 2017, Brookdale was operating with a skeleton crew, according to six current and former employees and court documents filed in a lawsuit brought by Ms. Johnson. Overwhelmed employees at the 120-bed facility would wake some residents as early as 3:30 a.m. to get them dressed for breakfast and then would put the residents back into bed to wait the hours until mealtime, the lawsuit alleged.,More than a week passed before Ms. Johnson was first given a shower, her medical records show. Her surgical wound was not treated. No one came when she rang her call bell for help going to the toilet, so she sat for hours in her own urine and feces. At one point, Ms. Johnson said, a passing maintenance man changed her diaper.,On at least three days in her first month there, no one brought her pain medication. Some days there were no nurses on the floor tending to patients, according to the current and former employees and depositions in the pending lawsuit. Nurses spent an average of less than 30 minutes a day per patient.,Brookdale, however, told Medicare that each resident received an average of 75 minutes of daily care. The home arrived at that number by including nurses who were stationed at Brookdale’s corporate headquarters in Tennessee, some 200 miles away, according to depositions and the employees.,Absent the inflated staffing numbers, Brookdale’s rating would most likely have fallen to one or two stars.,Jessica Crutchfield, a nursing assistant who worked at the Brookdale home while Ms. Johnson was there, said in a deposition last year that her supervisors told her to falsify residents’ medical records to make it look like they received more care than they did. When she refused, she was fired, she said.,Heather Hunter, a spokeswoman for Brookdale, said, “We have detailed policies in place to ensure compliance with C.M.S. reporting rules, and we are not aware of any instance where inaccurate or false information was submitted by any of our communities outside of the confines of the C.M.S. rules.”,Ms. Johnson’s incision began to fester. In November 2017, a physical therapist noticed that it “appeared open and presented with discoloration around incisions.” She alerted the nursing staff, records show, but it took six days before anyone treated the wound.,When Ms. Johnson went to an outside doctor, her wound was infected, medical records show. The doctor sent her to the hospital. The infection left her unable to move. Her muscles atrophied.,Ms. Hunter didn’t comment on what happened to Ms. Johnson. “While The New York Times has the right to print unproven allegations from one side of a lawsuit seeking monetary damages, we choose not to litigate unsubstantiated facts in the press,” she said.,Ms. Johnson now lives at home. She used to manage the kitchen at a local homeless shelter; now she can’t walk or even stand. She said she spends about six hours a day in front of the television, waiting for her husband to get back from work. She misses cooking sloppy joes for her six grandchildren.,“I wouldn’t send my dog there,” Ms. Johnson said of Brookdale. “That five-star rating is garbage.”,Medicare began tracking nursing homes’ use of certain prescription drugs after the Health and Human Services inspector general , that facilities were overusing antipsychotic drugs, which can be especially dangerous for older people. The ratings system now penalizes homes that overmedicate residents.,According to court documents and interviews with nurses, administrators and government officials, nursing homes for years have underreported the number of residents on opiates and antipsychotics.,On Dec. 12, 2017, Eunice Hill checked into National Healthcare Corporation’s nursing home in Greenville, S.C., for what was supposed to be a short-term rehab stay after a nasty fall made it hard for her to walk. (National Healthcare, a publicly traded company, operates 75 facilities around the United States.) Ms. Hill’s daughter, Anne Brown, said she and her mother drew comfort from the facility’s five-star rating.,That first day at the nursing home, staff gave Ms. Hill Haldol, a powerful antipsychotic, her medical records show. She was also given anti-anxiety medications every day for a week.,That is not what National Healthcare told the government. At least four times a year, nursing homes are required to provide C.M.S. “minimum data sets” for each patient, the equivalent of medical report cards that detail things like weight, medications and wounds. In Ms. Hill’s data set, National Healthcare said that she did not receive any antipsychotics and only got anti-anxiety drugs once.,A National Healthcare spokeswoman declined to comment, citing a pending lawsuit that Ms. Hill’s daughter filed against the company.,Ms. Hill, 93 and suffering from diabetes, started skipping meals, causing her blood sugar levels to go wild, according to her medical records. In late December, she was rushed to a hospital. Doctors found her kidneys were failing and that she was severely dehydrated.,She died on Jan. 3, less than a month after she arrived at the National Healthcare home.,At the Good Samaritan home in Albert Lea, Minn., a resident’s foot became infested with , in 2018 after her bandages were left on for days. At Dwelling Place in Dover, N.J., staff didn’t change residents’ , for more than a month last year, increasing the risk of infection.,In both cases, government health inspectors determined that the nursing homes failed to keep their residents safe. Yet both earned five stars.,The C.M.S. rating system puts the greatest weight on in-person inspections; they are the starting point for the final star rating.,But the exams do little to penalize homes with serious problems. At nearly 1,200 homes with five stars, inspectors over a three-year period identified at least one problem involving potential patient abuse, such as violence committed by staff or the failure to investigate injuries, The Times found.,In 2019, health inspectors , a nursing assistant at the Reo Vista home in San Diego had followed a resident who uses a wheelchair to her room from the kitchen, where she was getting a late-night sandwich. The employee pushed her on the bed and raped her, according to the inspection report.,The report classified the attack as a “category F” violation, a low-level problem that caused potential, not actual, harm.,That designation helped Reo Vista hold onto its perfect rating, which it trumpets on its website.,“This former staff member’s actions do not reflect the values we hold at our facility that our overall five-star rating more accurately reflects,” said William Fredricksen, Reo Vista’s administrator. He said the home was using background checks and other means “to ensure that something like this never again occurs at our facility.”,At 40 other five-star nursing homes, inspectors similarly determined that sexual abuse did not constitute actual harm or put residents in “immediate jeopardy,” The Times found.,After a complaint in 2019, for example, inspectors , that a nursing assistant at Hickory Creek in Madison, Ind., had barged into the bathroom while a resident was showering and groped her breasts. Hickory Creek kept its five stars.,Hickory Creek officials didn’t respond to requests for comment.,At Manor Care in Boca Raton, Fla., John Schulz, a 57-year-old resident with Alzheimer’s, was strangled to death by another resident in 2019. The state coroner ruled it a homicide. The death doesn’t appear in inspection records at all. The facility has a five-star rating.,“The unfortunate incident was very isolated,” said Julie Beckert, a spokeswoman. She said staff responded “quickly and appropriately” to the strangulation.,In theory, health inspections can occur at any time, without notice.,But The Times found that in 2019 about 70 percent of nursing homes increased their staff on the days that inspectors visited, compared with their typical staffing levels on that day of the week.,On average, the homes added 25 hours of staff time — a roughly 8 percent increase — to their rosters on the day of the inspection. For more than 800 facilities, inspection day was the best-staffed day of the year.,The odds of that happening randomly are virtually zero, suggesting that many homes are able to anticipate their inspection dates.,When inspectors visited Mitchell-Hollingsworth Nursing & Rehabilitation Center in Florence, Ala., on a Thursday in,September 2019, the home recorded its highest level of staffing all year: 785 total hours worked by nurses and aides, 15 percent higher than other Thursdays that year.,“We have absolutely no indication of when the inspectors are coming,” said Brian Scheri, the home’s administrator.,In some cases, corruption was to blame. In 2017, a state health inspector in Florida , to accepting $500,000 in bribes for telling homes about future inspections. Fifteen years earlier, the head of Oklahoma’s health department pleaded guilty to similar charges.,Nursing home staff and state-funded watchdogs said in interviews that hundreds of homes seemed to know in advance about the timing of inspections.,“Every home seemed to get a tip and would roll out the red carpet,” said Tony Cisney, a former inspector responsible for visiting about a dozen homes in Kentucky.,The coronavirus hit America’s nursing homes harder than any other part of the country. Nearly one out of every 10 nursing home residents died from Covid-19.,The pandemic laid bare the flaws in the government rating system.,The state health inspections do little to penalize homes with poor records of preventing and controlling infections. From 2017 to 2019, The Times found, inspectors cited nearly 60 percent — more than 2,000 — of the country’s five-star facilities at least once for not following basic safety precautions, like regular hand washing. Yet they earned top ratings.,In San Bernardino, Calif., inspectors wrote up Del Rosa Villa for four different infection-control violations. It kept its five stars. Ninety residents at the 104-bed facility have contracted the coronavirus, and 13 have died.,Del Rosa Villa officials didn’t respond to requests for comment.,Life Care Centers of Kirkland, Wash., the first nursing home in the United States to have documented coronavirus cases, was found in 2019 to have weak infection controls, despite its five stars. State inspectors wrote it up for failing to “consistently implement an effective infection control program.”,Thirty-nine of the facility’s , have died from Covid-19. The home has 190 beds.,Leigh Atherton, a Life Care spokeswoman, said that citation was the only lapse in infection control that inspectors had identified over 32 previous visits. She said the home quickly fixed the problem.,If the rating system worked as intended, it would have offered clues as to which homes were most likely to have out-of-control outbreaks and which homes would probably muddle through.,That is not what happened.,The Times found that there was little if any correlation between star ratings and how homes fared during the pandemic. At five-star facilities, the death rate from Covid-19 was only half a percentage point lower than at facilities that received lower ratings. And the death rate was slightly lower at two-star facilities than at four-star homes.,A facility’s location, the infection rate of the surrounding community and the race of nursing home residents , of whether a nursing home would suffer an outbreak. The star ratings didn’t matter.,That is consistent with academic research. , found little relationship between a facility’s star rating and its Covid-19 infection and death rates.,At Fulton Commons Care in East Meadow, N.Y., its five stars largely stemmed from its self-reported data, which researchers have found at times to be incorrect.,The home reported only 11 instances of residents taking serious falls between 2011 and 2015. The University of Chicago researchers, however, identified 40 falls for which residents were hospitalized. Similarly, Integra Med Analytics found that, at most, Fulton Commons was reporting to C.M.S. one-third of its residents’ pressure ulcers. The research firm , the home deserved one star, not five.,Fulton Commons officials did not respond to requests for comment.,Fulton Commons stopped allowing visitors last March. Automated phone calls assured family members that the virus hadn’t infiltrated the home.,Stasia Kochanowska died from Covid-19 on April 10. That same day, another resident, 88-year-old Adele Guyear, spoke to her daughter, Pamela Martin. Usually bubbly, Ms. Guyear now sounded terrified. She said her roommate had died from the virus. So had two women down the hall. And, Ms. Guyear told her daughter, she had a bad cough.,Ms. Martin initially had been comforted by the home’s five-star rating. But during the pandemic she had struggled to get her phone calls returned. Now, hearing from her mother, Ms. Martin began to panic.,She said she called the home and demanded that Ms. Guyear be sent to a hospital. There, she tested positive for Covid-19. Her mother survived, but she can’t breathe without supplemental oxygen, Ms. Martin said.,On May 15, health inspectors cited Fulton Commons for having a deficient program for preventing and controlling infections. C.M.S. , the problem as causing “minimal harm or the potential for actual harm.” The facility kept its five stars.,Forty-one Fulton Commons residents have died from Covid-19.,“Knowing what I know now,” Ms. Martin said, “you’d have to be crazy to give this place a five-star rating.”,The Times’s analysis of the star system’s effectiveness was based in large part on data submitted to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or C.M.S. The Times used data from ,, before the pandemic upended the industry and temporarily changed data-collection practices. The primary analysis examined the characteristics of homes with five-star ratings, including their staffing patterns and code violations.,The core data set was from the Nursing Home Compare system. That included the most recent set of star ratings for each facility and the underlying metrics. To see how these ratings changed over time, The Times also examined , and metrics going back to 2015.,The Times looked at all code violations reported in the three inspection cycles included in the January 2020 data.,The analysis also incorporated nursing homes’ 2019 , (daily logs of the hours worked by nurses, aides and administrators) and , (financial statements that facilities submit to the government). The cost reports were used to examine the relationship between profitability and the star system.,In addition, The Times used summary data provided by researchers who were granted access to individualized data on Medicare claims. By examining how often nursing home residents were admitted to hospitals , or complications from ,, the researchers demonstrated the extent to which facilities underreported serious health incidents in data they submit for ratings purposes.,Susan Beachy contributed research.",business
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/business/biden-electric-vehicles-infrastructure.html,"Biden’s Push for Electric Cars: $174 Billion, 10 Years and a Bit of Luck","President Biden is a muscle-car guy — one of his , that he got from his father. But he’s trying to make this an electric vehicle world.,The , that he , is aimed at tackling climate change in part by spending up to $174 billion to encourage Americans to switch to cars and trucks that run on electricity, not gasoline or diesel. That is a large investment but it might not be enough to push most Americans toward E.V.s.,Despite rapid growth in recent years, electric vehicles remain a niche product, making up just 2 percent of the new car market and 1 percent of all cars, sport-utility vehicles, vans and pickup trucks on the road. They have been slow to take off in large part because they can cost up to $10,000 more than similar conventional cars and trucks. Charging E.V.s is also more difficult and slower than simply refilling the tank at far more prevalent gas stations.,Mr. Biden hopes to address many of those challenges through federal largess. He aims to lower the cost of electric vehicles by offering individuals, businesses and governments tax credits, rebates and other incentives. To address the chicken-and-egg problem of getting people to try a new technology before it is widely accepted, he hopes to build half a million chargers by 2030 so people will feel confident that they won’t be stranded when they run out of juice. And he is offering help to automakers to get them to build electric vehicles and batteries in the United States.,“We find ourselves at a unique moment here where most American businesses and many states are looking toward a decarbonized future, but recognize there’s a big lift on the infrastructure side,” said Bob Perciasepe, president of the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, an environmental research group. “This investment alone obviously won’t solve the climate problem or fix all of the infrastructure in the United States but it will be a huge boost.”,Automakers see the writing on the wall and many, including ,. But even they acknowledge that they will need federal help.,“This transformation is greater than any one policy, branch or level of government, or industry sector,” a group representing ,. “It will require a sustained holistic approach with a broad range of legislative and regulatory policies rooted in economic, social, environmental and cultural realities.”,The letter called for grants, loans, tax credits and tax deductions to promote research and manufacturing. The authors of the letter, which included industry groups and the United Auto Workers union, called for investment in job training programs and federal help in promoting development of minerals and other raw materials in the United States.,But production is only one piece of the puzzle. The transition away from gas-powered vehicles rests on convincing consumers of the benefits of electric vehicles. That hasn’t been easy because the cars have higher sticker prices even though researchers say that they cost less to own. Electricity is cheaper on a per mile basis than gasoline, and E.V.s require less routine maintenance — there is no oil to change — than combustion-engine cars.,The single biggest cost of an electric car comes from the battery, which can run about $15,000 for a midsize sedan. That cost has been dropping and is widely expected to keep falling thanks to manufacturing improvements and technical advancements. But some scholars believe that a major technological breakthrough will be required to make electric cars much, much cheaper.,“There’s a good sense that at least for the next maybe five years or so they’re going to keep declining, but then are they going to level off or are they going to keep declining?” Joshua Linn, a professor at the University of Maryland and a senior fellow with Resources for the Future, an environmental nonprofit, said about battery costs. “That won’t be enough, so then that’s given rise to a lot of attention to infrastructure.”,The federal government and some states already offer tax credits and other incentives for the purchase of electric cars. But the main such federal incentive — a $7,500 tax credit for the purchase of new electric cars — begins to phase out for cars once an automaker has sold 200,000 E.V.s. Buyers of Tesla and G.M. electric cars, for example, no longer qualify for that tax credit but buyers of Ford and Volkswagen electric cars do.,Mr. Biden described his incentives for electric car purchases as rebates available at the “point of sale,” presumably meaning at dealerships or while ordering cars online. But the administration has not released details about how big those rebates will be and which vehicles they would apply to.,Another big concern is charging. People with dedicated parking spots typically charge their E.V.s overnight at home, but many people who live in apartments or have to drive longer distances need to use public charging stations, which are still greatly outnumbered by gas stations.,“The top three reasons consumers give for not buying E.V.s are lack of charging stations, time to charge, and the cost of E.V.s,” said Sam Abuelsamid, an analyst at Guidehouse Insights. “They seem to be really emphasizing all three. So, over all, it looks very promising.”,There are ,, most with multiple pumps. Mr. Biden’s plan calls for a national network of 500,000 electric vehicle chargers within the decade, up from , with more than 100,000 outlets today, according to the Energy Department.,“One of the things that needs to be addressed is getting chargers into places where people only have on-street parking, like in cities and urban areas where you don’t have a driveway or garage,” Mr. Abuelsamid said. “If they can address that, it will make E.V.s available to a lot more people.”,The government in China, which leads the world in the use of electric cars, has done much more than the United States to speed up the installation of chargers.,“It is, famously, one of the ways that China has become the No. 1 country in E.V.s on most dimensions,” John Paul MacDuffie, a professor of management at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, said in an email.,Even with incentives for manufacturers, a robust charging network and a willing public, the transition to electric cars may take a few decades. Carmakers have improved vehicle reliability in recent years, so many cars stay on the road a long time. The average age of cars and light trucks in the United States ,, up from 9.6 years in 2002, according to IHS Markit, an economic forecasting firm.,Neal E. Boudette, contributed reporting.",business
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/30/sports/ncaabasketball/ncaa-womens-tournament-final-four.html,South Carolina and Stanford Round Out Women’s Final Four,"SAN ANTONIO — Sixth-seeded Texas went cold at the worst possible moment, failing to muster a credible threat to South Carolina. Louisville had a clear shot at Stanford, but the top-seeded Cardinal came back — and then some — in the second half.,Both Stanford and South Carolina, No. 1 seeds in an N.C.A.A. women’s basketball tournament field that has commanded a fair share of difficulty for teams at the top, moved on to the Final Four on Tuesday night to join another No. 1 seed, UConn, and third-seeded Arizona.,Stanford claimed the last spot in the national semifinals with a 78-63 defeat of Louisville, after trailing by 12 points at halftime. South Carolina sailed in the round of 8 with a 62-34 win over Texas.,In the ultimate sign of futility after a run that included upsets of U.C.L.A. and Maryland, Texas scored 0 points in the fourth quarter — missing all 15 of its shots. The Longhorns shot 23 percent for the game.,The Gamecocks dominated from the start to earn their third trip to the national semifinals and their first since winning a national title in 2017.,“When we got knocked down four times this season, they got back up stronger,” South Carolina Coach Dawn Staley said in a television interview after the game, referring to the Gamecocks’ four losses this year. “And that’s the mark of a true champion.”,Louisville’s Dana Evans put up 10 of her 24 points in the first quarter while the Cardinals kept Stanford below 28 percent shooting in the first half.,But a 13-0 run toward the end of the third quarter put the Cardinal ahead as they started containing Louisville’s top scorers. Then, Stanford ran away over the last 10 minutes. Lexie Hull had 21 points and 9 rebounds while Haley Jones had 10 points and 10 rebounds.,Stanford’s Ashten Prechtel, who finished with 16 points and made all six of her shots, opened the fourth quarter with a 3-pointer that bolstered Stanford’s confidence and sparked a decisive run.,“It was tough to not play in the first half — and I was nervous,” Prechtel said about Louisville’s lead. At halftime, Prechtel said Stanford Coach Tara VanDerveer “ripped into us a little bit” and told them they had to “compete in the second half” if they wanted to stay in San Antonio.,“Coming out of halftime, there was urgency to how we were going to play,” Prechtel said.,According to the N.C.A.A., two Black women will be head coaches in the Final Four for the first time: Staley for South Carolina and Adia Barnes of No. 3 Arizona, which will face UConn in the national semifinal.,“There are so many Black coaches out there that don’t get the opportunity, because when A.D.’s don’t see it, they don’t see it,” Staley told reporters after the game, referring to athletic directors. “They’re going to see it in the Final Four on Friday night.”,“Representation matters, and its nothing against anyone else who lost to us,” she added. “I hope that the decision-makers — because there are a lot of jobs out there — that you give Black women the opportunity.”,Staley’s team weaved through Texas’ notorious defense with ease, with Zia Cooke and Destanni Henderson repeatedly feeding Victaria Saxton in the paint. Cooke led with 16 points, and added 6 rebounds and 3 assists. Henderson had 12 points and 7 assists, while Saxton had 12 points and 8 rebounds.,The Longhorns got into gear briefly in the third quarter as more and more Texas fans trickled into the audience after work hours, bolstering the cheers and outcries that bounced around the cavernous stadium walls at the Alamodome.,Audrey Warren, who led Texas with 13 points, scored two of her — and the team’s — three 3-pointers in the third quarter. And at one point, Texas came within 10 points of South Carolina on a second-chance layup by Lauren Ebo.,But that was as close as the Longhorns got after South Carolina took an early 15-point lead and scored 14 points off Texas turnovers. Looking exhausted and downtrodden after Warren scored their final points in the third quarter, the Longhorns let South Carolina celebrate early with a big run while they continued to watch their shots bounce off the rim, not adding a single point to their score in the final 10-minute period.,“It was hard for me to not get too excited,” South Carolina’s Cooke said of the last quarter in a call with reporters after the game.,It was the first scoreless period of the women’s tournament since the N.C.A.A. switched from halves to quarters in 2016, according to the ,. (, had previously set a record for the lowest-scoring quarter in a tournament game with a 1-point period against Oregon in the first round.),“I thought it was a pretty good defensive performance, but I also think that Texas was a little tired,” Staley said.,The Longhorns and Gamecocks had ,, however Texas Coach Vic Schaefer and Staley have — including for the national title in Dallas in 2017, when Schaefer was coaching Mississippi State. The Bulldogs ,, but , for its only championship. Staley beat Schaefer in 12 out of their 15 meetings while they were Southeastern Conference foes.,“I always look forward to playing Vic because of what he puts into his scouting reports, his game-planning and his scheming,” Staley told reporters on Monday.,Even without the pandemic, Texas went through significant transition this summer when Schaefer took over for longtime coach Karen Aston. Players recalled struggling to get to know each other and their coaches during video calls and limited practices, and said that has helped them bond and peak at the right time within the controlled environment set up for the tournament.,It was a relatively quiet night for South Carolina sophomore forward Aliyah Boston and Texas junior center Charli Collier, who had both averaged double-doubles this tournament and went head-to-head on Tuesday night. Boston, who is up for a few player-of-the-year awards, had 10 points and 8 rebounds; Collier, who is projected to be the No. 1 pick in the W.N.B.A. draft, was held to 4 points after missing 8 of 10 shots.,Boston also had a slow start during South Carolina’s round-of-16 game against Georgia Tech but picked it up in the second half where she scored all 9 points. But in that game her teammates stepped in, led by Cooke on the perimeter with 17 points in a 76-65 win.,With its powerhouse defense, Texas was also able to hold No. 2 seed Maryland to its lowest score of the season in a , by limiting the Terrapins’ possessions and forcing 11 turnovers.,The fans helped too, Schaefer said. The university, located in Austin, is about 80 miles from San Antonio, the hub for the tournament where most of its games have been staged. “I thought our fans provided a great environment for both teams,” Schaefer said Monday.,South Carolina will play top-seeded Stanford. On Monday night, No. 1-seeded UConn and No. 3-seeded Arizona , to set up the other semifinal. Both semifinals are scheduled for Friday night.",business
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/business/suez-canal-ship-costs.html,Clearing the Suez Canal Took Days. Figuring Out the Costs May Take Years.,"TOKYO — It took six days to , that ran aground and clogged the Suez Canal, one of the world’s most crucial shipping arteries. It could take years to sort out who will pay for the mess.,Cargo companies, insurers, government authorities and a phalanx of lawyers, all with different agendas and potential assessments, will need to determine not only the total damage but also what went wrong. When they eventually finish digging through the morass, the insurers of the ship’s Japanese owner are likely to bear the brunt of the financial pain.,The costs could add up quickly.,There are the repairs for any damage to the Ever Given, the quarter-mile-long ship that got stuck in the Suez. There is the bill for the tugboats and front-end loaders that dug the beached vessel out from the mud. The authority that operates the, has already said the crisis has cost the Egyptian government up to $90 million in lost toll revenue as hundreds of ships waited to pass through the blocked waterway or took other routes.,And the stalled ship , from moving through the canal, including cars, oil, livestock, laptops, sneakers, electronics and toilet paper. Companies delivering goods may have to pay customers for missed deadlines. If any agricultural goods went bad, producers may look to recoup lost revenue.,All of these cascading effects could amount to insurance claims in the hundreds of millions of dollars, as well as broader losses from the delays in the global supply chain.,The financial mess will ensnare a multinational web of businesses, led by the Japanese owner of the ship, its Taiwanese operator and the German management agent that hired the crew, as well as myriad cargo companies that rented space in the ship’s containers and a pool of insurance firms stretching from Tokyo to London.,The ultimate responsibility may fall to the insurers for the ship’s owner, Shoei Kisen Kaisha, a subsidiary of the 120-year-old privately owned Japanese shipbuilder Imabari.,Teams from the German company that hired the crew and a consortium of insurers for the ship’s owner are just starting to investigate what caused the marooning of the Ever Given. Authorities in Panama, where the ship is registered, are also conducting an inquiry, as are investigators for other interested parties. Their findings, whether they align or not, will complicate questions of liability, keeping claims adjusters and lawyers busy for years as they sort through the finger-pointing.,Investigators want to know “who was responsible for the disruption — was it the crew, the pilots working for the Suez Canal Authority, or is it just an act of nature or a freak accident by the wind?” said ,, an associate professor of supply chain management at the Curtin Business School in Perth, Australia. ,Even after inquiries are completed, “it’s not clear cut,” Mr. Oloruntoba added. “It all depends on how good the lawyers are and also the contracts that were entered into.”,The most straightforward aspect is the damage to the ship and the canal. In the shipping business, those costs usually fall to the insurers of the ship’s owner, in this case a consortium led by Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance in Tokyo with Tokio Marine and Sompo Japan. Initial reports indicate that the ship did not suffer much harm and that there was no pollution leak.,The consortium is also likely to be on the hook for the salvage costs to free the ship, which swelled as experts and equipment were mobilized on short notice. Robert Mazzuoli, an insurance analyst at Fitch Ratings, estimated that bill could run into the tens of millions, although there are many variables.,The trickier piece of the puzzle is the cargo. Companies that booked containers on the Ever Given, as well as some of the 400 ships that had to wait in line outside the canal while it was jammed, may want to file claims.,But most insurance policies do not cover the economic losses for cargo delays. So companies will have to make a specific case as to why they are entitled to compensation. ,Such claims could reach hundreds of millions of dollars.,The ships carrying the most time-sensitive cargo, such as livestock or produce, could make the strongest argument. Those vessels, though, were allowed to go through first once the waterway was cleared.,For the most part, claims around cargo might be “impractical,” said ,, a lawyer in Taipei who specializes in commercial and transportation law.,“While the ship is just parked there, the cargo isn’t actually being damaged,” Mr. Lee said. “The only damage is that it’s delayed.”,“Say I have a batch of cloth, and on top of the time it took to come to Taiwan, it got stuck for six or seven days,” he said. “It just sat there. Will it go bad? It won’t.” ,There is a caveat. The ship’s owner could have to pay for cargo delays, if its crew is found to be at fault for the accident.,Some so-called third-party claims related to delayed cargo may be covered by yet another insurer for the ship, the UK P&I Club. The same goes for any claims by the Suez Canal Authority, which operates the waterway and might file over any loss of revenue.,Nick Shaw, chief executive of the International Group of Protection and Indemnity Clubs, the umbrella group that includes the UK P&I Club, said the insurer would “make decisions together with the shipowner as to which ones had validity and which ones are illegitimate.”,Adding to the complexity of the Suez accident are the layers upon layers of insurance. Reinsurers, companies that covers the risk of other insurance companies, come into play for claims above $100 million. Between insurance and reinsurance, the ship’s owner has coverage for those third-party claims up to $3.1 billion, although few experts believe the damages will run that high.,The sheer size of the Ever Given makes the situation all the more labyrinthine. Aside from time of war, the Suez Canal has never been blocked quite so spectacularly or for as long as it was by the Ever Given, and this is the biggest ship to run aground.,The ship is as long as the Empire State Building is tall, with the capacity to carry 20,000 containers stacked 12 to 14 high. The Ever Given is one of a fleet of 13 in a series designed by Imabari, part of a push to lower the costs per container and make the ships more competitive in an increasingly fierce market dominated by Chinese and South Korean shipbuilders.,“The bigger the ships get, the risk is whenever you have an incident like this is that you are putting more of your eggs into one basket,” said Simon Heaney, senior manager of container research at Drewry UK, a shipping consultancy. “So the claims will magnify.”,Raymond Zhong, and ,Amy Chang Chien, contributed reporting from Taipei, Taiwan. ,Vivian Yee, contributed from Cairo, and ,Makiko Inoue,, ,Hisako Ueno, and ,Hikari Hida, from Tokyo.",business
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/30/sports/football/nfl-adds-17th-regular-season-game.html,N.F.L. Officially Adds 17th Regular Season Game,"The N.F.L. formally agreed to add a 17th regular season game on Tuesday, the first expansion of the league’s schedule since 1978.,To make room for the extra game, the league’s owners removed one preseason game, leaving three for each team. The upcoming regular season will begin on Thursday, Sept. 9 and end one week later than usual, on Sunday, Jan. 9, 2022. Super Bowl LVI, which will be played in Inglewood, Calif., will also move back one week, to Sunday, Feb. 13, 2022.,Teams will continue to have only one bye week during the season.,Team owners approved the expansion at an annual meeting held virtually, but the new calendar structure had been all but guaranteed to move forward after the league announced on , with CBS, Fox and other media companies. The ,, reached in March 2020, gave team owners the option to add an extra regular season game if the league signed at least one new media deal.,With the addition of a 17th regular season game on top of the two extra playoff games the league added last season, the N.F.L. negotiated substantially higher rates for its media rights. The new deals, which total more than $100 billion, nearly double the amount of the expiring contracts.,“One of the benefits of each team playing 17 regular-season games is the ability for us to continue to grow our game around the world,” N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell said in a statement.,During negotiations on the labor contract last year, ,, opposed adding a 17th regular season game. The owners ultimately won over reluctant union members, who approved the agreement by just 60 votes, with players getting a bump in their share of the N.F.L.’s revenue, up to 48.5 percent from 47 under the old deal.,Some players remain opposed to a longer season. Denver Broncos safety Kareem Jackson called the ,. New Orleans Saints running back Alvin Kamara ,to convey his displeasure, before tempering his reaction by,, “17 games still dumb,” on the app.,Goodell said in a conference call with reporters that players would still play a total of 20 preseason and regular season games. Injury rates, he said, are higher during preseason games, so eliminating one could lead to fewer injuries. Most established players, though, play only sparingly during the preseason, when coaches prefer to evaluate free agents and rookies as they vie for roster spots.,On Tuesday, the owners also approved a rule that would require all 32 teams to play an overseas game at least once every eight years. This will allow the league to schedule up to four neutral-site games each year outside the United States starting in 2022. Teams like the Green Bay Packers have been reluctant to play internationally because they did not want to give up the revenue from a home game and because of the stress of additional travel. In recent years, some franchises have been willing to play games in London and in Mexico City in exchange for the right to host a Super Bowl. The new rule would end that trade-off.,As the league looks to grow the game’s international footprint, N.F.L. executives said it may also return to playing games in Canada, as well as in South America and elsewhere in Europe, including Germany. Chris Halpin, the N.F.L.’s chief strategy and growth officer, said finding a Canadian stadium that meets the league’s specifications for hosting a game remains an issue.,The 17-game regular season will give half of the N.F.L.’s teams an extra home game each season. For simplicity’s sake, the 17th game will be hosted by all teams from one conference on a rotating basis. In 2021, every A.F.C. team will host nine regular season games, while N.F.C. teams will host eight. In 2022, N.F.C. teams will get the ninth home game.,As usual, teams will play home and away against their three divisional rivals for a total of six games. Interdivisional games within the same conference will continue on a rotating, three-year cycle, interconference games, on a four-year cycle. Remaining games will be determined based on the prior year’s standings.,The newly added 17th game will be between interconference teams based on the prior year’s standings. A first-place team from one division will face a first-place team from a division in the opposing conference that it had not been scheduled to play based on the usual scheduling rotations.,That will lead to some intriguing interconference games in 2021. The Green Bay Packers, for instance, winners of the NF.C. North last season, will travel to Kansas City to play the Chiefs, who won the A.F.C. West. The Seattle Seahawks, winners of the N.F.C. West, will play the Steelers in Pittsburgh, while the , will play the Colts in Indianapolis.,The N.F.L. will announce the dates and times of all these games in the coming weeks.",sports

That muted response drew fierce criticism, as well as protests at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport and calls for a boycott.,But on Wednesday, Ed Bastian, Delta’s chief executive, made a stark reversal. “I need to make it crystal clear that the final bill is unacceptable and does not match Delta’s values,” he wrote in an internal memo that was reviewed by The New York Times.,Coca-Cola, another of Georgia’s largest companies, which had also declined to take a position on the legislation before it passed, made a similarly worded statement.,“I want to be crystal clear,” said James Quincey, Coca-Cola’s chief executive. “The Coca-Cola Company does not support this legislation, as it makes it harder for people to vote, not easier.”,Less than a day before the abrupt reversals, a group of prominent Black executives ,to publicly oppose a wave of similarly restrictive voting bills that Republicans are advancing in almost every state.,But the statements won’t change the outcome in Georgia, where the new law introduced stricter voter identification requirements for absentee balloting, limited drop boxes in predominantly Black neighborhoods and expanded the legislature’s power over elections.,“It is regrettable that the sense of urgency came after the legislation was passed and signed into law,” said Darren Walker, the president of the Ford Foundation and a board member at Ralph Lauren, Pepsi and Square.,Mr. Bastian decided to write the memo and revise the company’s position on Tuesday night after speaking with Kenneth Chenault, a former chief executive of American Express who helped organize ,, according to three people familiar with the conversation.,In the memo, Mr. Bastian said it was only after the law was passed that he truly understood the degree to which it would impose restrictions on Black voters.,“After having time to now fully understand all that is in the bill, coupled with discussions with leaders and employees in the Black community, it’s evident that the bill includes provisions that will make it harder for many underrepresented voters, particularly Black voters, to exercise their constitutional right to elect their representatives,” he said. “That is wrong.”,Mr. Bastian went further, saying the new law was based on false pretenses.,“The entire rationale for this bill was based on a lie: that there was widespread voter fraud in Georgia in the 2020 elections,” he said. “This is simply not true. Unfortunately, that excuse is being used in states across the nation that are attempting to pass similar legislation to restrict voting rights.”,Several other companies also weighed in on the issue on Wednesday.,Larry Fink, the chief executive of BlackRock, issued a statement on , saying the company was concerned about the wave of new restrictive voting laws. “BlackRock is concerned about efforts that could limit access to the ballot for anyone,” Mr. Fink said. “Voting should be easy and accessible for ALL eligible voters.”,Mark Mason, the chief financial officer of Citi, in a post on ,, called out the Georgia law as discriminatory.,“I am appalled by the recent voter suppression laws passed in the state of Georgia,” said Mr. Mason, who is Black. “I see it as a disgrace that our country’s efforts to keep Black Americans from engaging fully in our Constitutional right to vote continue to this day.”,Chuck Robbins, who is the chief executive of Cisco and grew up in Georgia, , on Twitter that “voting is a fundamental right in our democracy” and that “governments should be working to make it easier to vote, not harder.”,And Brad Smith, the president of Microsoft, wrote a , about the Georgia law, detailing what he saw as the legislation’s failings and suggesting that corporate America try to get it changed.,“We hope that companies will come together and make clear that a healthy business requires a healthy community,” Mr. Smith said. “And a healthy community requires that everyone have the right to vote conveniently, safely, and securely. This new law falls short of the mark, and we should work together to press the Georgia legislature to change it.”,Andrew Ross Sorkin, contributed reporting.",sports

https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/30/sports/skiing/mikaela-shiffrin-skiing-olympics.html,Mikaela Shiffrin Is Not Going Downhill,"Mikaela Shiffrin, the two-time Olympic Alpine champion, stopped competing 13 months ago, an absence tied to the accidental , and later extended by the coronavirus pandemic and a back injury sustained in training.,Shiffrin returned to the start gate in December and in the next four months won three World Cup races and four medals in the world championships, the latter , for most career medals (11) and victories (six) at the event.,It was a successful winter by any measure, except perhaps Shiffrin’s recent past: In the 2018-19 season, she finished with an astonishing 17 World Cup victories. So it was not a surprise to Shiffrin that her statistical decline this season was much noted in the ski community, but she did not like all that she heard.,“One of the things that bugged me was so many people saying, ‘Oh, she’s lost it,’” Shiffrin said in a telephone interview from Europe last week. “You know, I’m still here, I’m still doing it.”,Shiffrin chuckled.,“It’s true it wasn’t as good a year as I’ve had in the past,” she said, adding that many people around the world, not just ski racers, could say the same thing about the previous 12 months. “But when I look back at this season I’ll be proud. I didn’t even know if there was going to be a World Cup or if I was emotionally ready for it. Then I was injured as the racing was starting, and in bed and not training. I felt like I was playing catch-up.”,Ultimately, her 300-day layoff and atypical results have provided Shiffrin with something significant as the 2022 Beijing Olympics approach: new incentive.,“I’m motivated from what was lacking this year,” Shiffrin, 26, said. “There’s some missing pieces. That’s one of my biggest goals — to get those back.”,Shiffrin said the best example of her renewed drive was her presence last week on the slopes of the Kuhtai Ski Resort in Austria, where she tested dozens of new skis not far from the headquarters of her equipment sponsor, Atomic. In previous years, after a demanding 21-race World Cup schedule in nine countries, she might have dashed home, as most North American skiers did when racing ended March 21.,“But this year, I want to stay here because I’m excited to do the work,” said Shiffrin, whose 69 World Cup victories rank third all time behind Ingemar Stenmark’s 86 and Lindsey Vonn’s 82. “And that’s a good place to be. I’m looking forward to all the off-season training I can get.”,Though the Beijing Olympics are 11 months away, they are already on her mind. Since Shiffrin is the rare athlete with the versatility to compete in each of the five Alpine events, she must soon decide whether to arrange the extensive spring and summer training needed to prepare for each race.,Then there is the uncertainty of the pandemic’s effect on the availability of on-snow training. Most years, Shiffrin would travel to practice in South America or New Zealand — or both — as well as in California and Colorado. Last summer, she was confined to the western United States.,For now, Shiffrin has not decided which races to enter at the Winter Games. She did not, for example, compete in a downhill race this past season, although her back injury in early October and the restricted training opportunities most likely contributed to that decision.,“I’m trying to decide what I want to ski in the Olympics and where I have the potential to be a medal contender,” Shiffrin said. “You have to be prepared before the next World Cup season starts because there’s a million things that can get in the way leading up to the Olympics.”,The Beijing Games will be Shiffrin’s third Olympics, but unlike in the period ahead of the 2014 Sochi Games and the 2018 Pyeongchang Olympics she has not skied on the mountain racecourses outside Beijing that will be used for the Alpine competitions. It is customary for test events to be staged at an Olympic venue a year or more in advance, but the ski areas outside Beijing get little natural snow — and the pandemic led to the suspension of travel and planning. Few top racers have skied at, or even visited, the Beijing sites.,“Nobody’s seen it,” Shiffrin said, “and that’s definitely going to add a layer of chaos when we arrive for the first time at the Games. Like, where do we go? What’s happening here?”,Shiffrin is encouraged that the focus on American Olympic ski racing prospects will be more diffuse than it was in 2018, when attention was reserved almost exclusively for her and the now-retired Vonn. Several of Shiffrin’s American teammates had breakout performances this winter, including Paula Moltzan, 26, who placed in the top 10 of the last three World Cup slalom races of the season. Moltzan’s teammate, Nina O’Brien, 23, finished 17th in the season-long giant slalom standings.,In December, Ryan Cochran-Siegle, the son of the 1972 Olympic Alpine gold medalist Barbara Cochran, became the first American man to win a World Cup super-G in 15 years.,“The team has shown a level of depth and consistency,” Shiffrin said, “that I haven’t experienced in my career.”,Next week, Shiffrin expects to head back to her home in Colorado, changed by the past 13 months.,On Feb. 2, 2020, her father, Jeff Shiffrin, an anesthesiologist in Denver, died at 65 from what a coroner ruled a home accident, listing the cause of death as a head injury.,“My life was flipped upside down and inside out,” Shiffrin said. “And never mind me, there was a pandemic. It changes your perspective.”,Noting that she has been on the World Cup circuit for 11 seasons, Shiffrin added: “A sort of staleness could have set in, but I feel lucky to do this and to have people around me who have given so much of themselves to help me be good at it.,“And I have a sense of wanting to figure out what I want to do better. Because I want to do better.”",sports
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/29/sports/ncaabasketball/houston-hangs-on-and-reaches-the-final-four.html,Houston Hangs On and Reaches the Final Four,"INDIANAPOLIS — Once upon a time, the Southwest Conference was where football ruled and renegades roamed. It was a land of envelopes stuffed with cash, sham jobs and recruiters bearing more gifts than Santa Claus. At one point, six schools were on N.C.A.A. probation, ,, and the string of scandals ensnared even a governor of Texas and a Texas A&M trustee who was a part owner of the Dallas Cowboys.,The league was also where nobody paid much attention to basketball.,The ,, a victim of its own excesses and the musical chairs of conference realignment, its members scattered across the college landscape. But for those who might carry some nostalgia for those wild (south)west days, this year’s Final Four is going to pull at the heartstrings the way boosters used to pull out wads of cash.,Two camps of the diaspora will come together in one national semifinal on Saturday after Houston ended a remarkable run by the No. 12 seed Oregon State with , in the Midwest regional final on Monday. The No. 2-seeded Cougars will play an old colleague, Baylor. The Bears, now in the Big 12, dispatched another Southwest alum, Arkansas, now in the Southeastern Conference, to win the South regional final, 81-72.,Baylor, a top seed, jumped to an early 18-point lead on its deadeye 3-point shooting and fended off the resilient Razorbacks down the stretch, clinching its first Final Four appearance since 1950.,The Cougars, who are in the Final Four for the time since 1984, had a more stressful time getting there. They blew a 17-point halftime lead but Quentin Grimes steadied them, hitting a 3-pointer from the top of the arc with 3 minutes, 21 seconds left, putting Houston ahead to stay.,“One thing you have to remind people, young men in these situations — don’t be afraid to fail,” Coach Kelvin Sampson said, recalling what he told his team during a timeout after Oregon State had tied the score. “Don’t be afraid to miss the shot. You certainly can’t be afraid to take it.”,The Cougars (28-3), who rallied from a 10-point, second-half deficit to beat No. 10-seeded Rutgers in the second round, have navigated a wrecked bracket, facing the 15th, 10th, 11th and 12th seeds. Their latest opponent, Oregon State (20-13), was trying to become the lowest seed to reach the Final Four.,Houston has a rich basketball history, dating to the 1960s when Elvin Hayes fueled a team that threatened U.C.L.A.’s dynasty and carrying through to the mid-1980s, when , — led by the future Hall of Famers Hakeem Olajuwon and Clyde Drexler — went to three consecutive Final Fours, losing back-to-back title games.,Much has happened since then. Little of it has been good for the Cougars.,Relegated to Conference USA once the Southwest disbanded in 1996 and then moving to the American Athletic Conference, Houston had little success fulfilling its athletic ambitions to rival big brother schools like Texas and Texas A&M. It hired Drexler as coach, but he flopped and left after two seasons.,One swing, though, has paid off — hiring Sampson, a sage but scandal-ridden coach. He drew the financial backing of Tilman Fertitta, the restaurant and casino mogul who owns the Houston Rockets. He poured $20 million into a campaign to renovate the Cougars’ Hofheinz Pavilion, now known as the Fertitta Center.,Sampson, who in 2018 led Houston to its first tournament-game victory in 34 years, now has the Cougars in position to win their first championship — and he would do it as an outsider.,The only team from outside the Power 6 conferences to win a championship since U.N.L.V. in 1990 was Connecticut in 2014, after its first season in the American after spending decades in the Big East. Houston fits that profile well with a band of transfers and overlooked talent.,Six Cougars, including four starters, began their careers elsewhere — ,, an acclaimed recruit who marked his arrival in college basketball at Kansas by scoring a game-high 21 points in a win over a Michigan State team that ended up in the Final Four.,But Grimes, not as comfortable as he wanted to be, returned home to Houston.,Sampson has been able to pitch a track record of development, burnished by six years he spent as an N.B.A. assistant, though that stint was essentially an exile after he landed Oklahoma and then Indiana on probation for violating N.C.A.A. rules. If this is a redemptive turn, it comes an hour’s drive north of where he was fired more than a decade ago.,If Sampson has rarely had elite talent, he has consistently built winners around hard-nosed ballplayers who build a fortress around the basket they are defending. In his 27 previous seasons as a head coach — at Washington State, Oklahoma, Indiana and Houston — that had been good enough to regularly reach the N.C.A.A. tournament but for just one trip to the Final Four, in 2002 with Oklahoma. The backcourt pair from that team — Hollis Price and Quannas White — are on his staff with the Cougars.,They were surely nodding with approval on Monday night as the Cougars took space away from Oregon State’s floor full of shooters, leaving them flustered. Price and White had to be particularly pleased with DeJon Jarreau, a sinewy 6-foot-5 guard who, like them, is from New Orleans.,A transfer from Massachusetts who spent a year at a community college, Jarreau had 10 points, 8 assists and 8 rebounds, but his best work may have been on defense. He was named the tournament’s most outstanding player. He badgered Ethan Thompson, who had scored 48 points in the previous two games and had been particularly adept at getting to the free-throw line, where he had made 25 of 26 shots in the tournament. On Monday, Thompson was limited to 11 points, though he contributed 7 rebounds and 6 assists to fuel Oregon State’s late charge.,“Man, it’s like a dream come true,” said Jarreau, who is at his third school with his best friend, reserve forward Brison Gresham. “Growing up, watching the Final Four, watching college basketball, you always think about getting to this point, seeing former players on TV do this. Like I said, as a kid, I’m watching TV growing up, and I’m like I hope I’ll be here one day, and man, I’m really here.”,There were similar sentiments when Baylor clinched its berth just after midnight.,As Kool and the Gang’s “Celebration” blared, players bounced around the court, hugged and mugged for selfies, and eventually took turns snipping the nets from the rims.,But in this pandemic season, it was a markedly different celebration. There were only several hundred Baylor fans there to share in the merrymaking, and the traditional confetti shower was a do-it-yourself exercise. The Bears grabbed handfuls from a bucket and tossed them in the air.,As the confetti fluttered down, a portion of the court recalled those days in the Southwest Conference, for it was awash in green.",sports

The Wildcats earned their first trip to the Final Four.,UConn has won the championship 11 times under Coach Geno Auriemma, who was mobbed by his team with paper confetti as he gave a postgame interview following the win.,Bueckers scored 28 points, asserting her presence early and then taking over again late as UConn turned back a determined Baylor team.,“Just to be a part of that history, that’s why I came here,” Bueckers said in a postgame interview.,Baylor held a 2-point lead going into the final quarter. The Bears repeatedly kept UConn from taking easy shots, knocking jumpers out of bounds and securing the ball off the glass to keep control. DiJonai Carrington served as her team’s main disruptive force off the bench, leading with 22 points, 7 rebounds and 2 steals and making numerous plays on defense to keep UConn from getting into a flow.,DiDi Richards, the 2020 Naismith defensive player of the year, went down clutching her left hamstring at the end of the third, and UConn started to close the gap. By the time Richards returned to the game, UConn had gained an advantage.,“The whole story of the game is DiDi Richards goes down and the whole momentum shifted,” Baylor Coach Kim Mulkey said.,The Huskies took the lead on a second-chance layup by Aaliyah Edwards with less than nine minutes left. Bueckers followed up with two jumpers, but the teams repeatedly fouled one another to inch the score up point by point. Two free throws with 19 seconds left by Carrington put Baylor back within a point of the win.,On Baylor’s penultimate possession, Carrington drove to the basket and wanted a foul to be called, but the referees did not blow the whistle and Baylor’s players were so frustrated that they delayed fouling as crucial time ticked away. “It’s a tough way to end a game,” Carrington said after the game. “Really frustrating, pictures don’t lie, tape don’t lie.”,It was UConn’s defense that came through at the end — the Bears missed their last four field goal attempts — to deliver yet another Final Four.,“This was harder than winning some of the national championships that we’ve won,” Auriemma said.,Mulkey had predicted correctly that the game could be “ugly,” with both teams scoring less than they were used to and turning the ball over more often.,The all-star matchup came a few months late: The Huskies were set to visit the Bears in Waco, Texas, in January before ,.,The last time the teams met was in January 2020, when the Bears — the reigning champion after , — walked away with a 74-58 win and ,. A year earlier, Baylor broke UConn’s ,.,Headed into their regional final, UConn and Baylor had met eight times, and ,.,“I wish it was for the national championship and not a chance to get to a Final Four because I think both programs are just elite and it’s a shame somebody has to lose,” Mulkey told reporters on Sunday.,Their matchup happening this early in the tournament was in part a credit to the depth at the top of the 64-team field, with Baylor as one of several formidable teams seeded second who could certainly be considered title contenders. Already in this tournament, some teams at the top have been tested, and one No. 1 seed, North Carolina State, ,.,“Explain to me how they are a No. 2 seed,” Auriemma said of Baylor on Sunday. “These things happen, I know, but I think they deserved to be an No. 1 seed, if you look around the rest of the tournament.”,To reach the round of 8, Baylor blew past its first- and second-round opponents but needed overtime to prevail against Michigan in the regional semifinal, 78-75.,Its best player this tournament has been NaLyssa Smith, a junior forward from Converse, Texas, who had made 26 of her 33 shots this tournament leading up to Monday’s game, including all 11 she took in Baylor’s round of 16 win. Against UConn, she had 14 points.,UConn has delivered three clear wins in this tournament, its first two without Auriemma present after he contracted the coronavirus. The Huskies won in the round of 16 by containing Caitlin Clark, the leading scorer in Division I, and Iowa in a 92-72 victory on Saturday. Bueckers has been the buzz for the Huskies — posting 62 points, 23 rebounds and 18 assists in their first three tournament games — but Saturday’s game reminded opponents that UConn’s depth is its true weapon.,Indiana gave Arizona a run for its money in a low-scoring game. After trailing throughout the third quarter, the Hoosiers tied the game going into the fourth thanks to a second-chance pull-up jumper by Aleksa Gulbe.,But Indiana missed its last three shots — and all nine of its 3-point attempts in the game.,Aari McDonald, Arizona’s leader who has a streak of 91 games scoring at least 10 points, had game highs of 33 points, 11 rebounds and 4 assists. She was walked off the court with less than three minutes to play to have her left ankle wrapped after a fall, but she returned to deliver a driving layup on a fast break and several free throws without a sign of pain. Her final free throw was the last bit of action before her teammates and coaches swarmed the court with a bucket of confetti.,On Tuesday night, top-seeded South Carolina faces No. 6 seed Texas while Stanford, another top seed, plays No. 2 seed Louisville for the other two spots in the national semifinals scheduled for Friday.",sports

Women’s Final Four: A First-Timer Crashes a Group of Powers,"The women’s basketball Final Four has all the narratives a fan could want.,A dynastic Connecticut program looking to reclaim its spot at the top. A traditionally great Stanford program aiming to recapture its former glory. South Carolina, the nation’s newest power, is establishing itself as a perennial contender. And Arizona, the Final Four first-timer, is working to make its mark.,If you missed this week’s games, and even if you didn’t, here’s a primer on what to look forward to in Friday’s national semifinals, where Stanford will play South Carolina before UConn faces Arizona.,It is probably a surprise to no one that Connecticut is in the Final Four. But predictably or not, and for the 13th consecutive season, Coach Geno Auriemma and his team are competing in the national semifinals after eking out a round of 8 win over Baylor. The Bears had led the Huskies by as many as 10 points, but crumbled after losing arguably their most important player, the national defensive player of the year DiDi Richards, to a hamstring injury late in the third quarter.,The Huskies’ close win showed the team’s strengths, and where the young squad and its freshman starters still occasionally stumble. First among those strengths is the freshman Paige Bueckers, who scored 28 points in the victory over Baylor, and has averaged 22.5 points in four tournament games.,“Paige does a lot of things that you can’t explain,” Auriemma said. “There are a lot of things that Paige has to learn, that she doesn’t handle so great right now. But like all great players, she can sense the moment, and she has the ability to fill that moment.”,The biggest boost for Connecticut so far in the tournament, though, has been the top-tier play of those around Bueckers. Christyn Williams and Evina Westbrook have given the team a boost from behind the 3-point line, and the 6-foot-4 Olivia Nelson-Ododa has become an unlikely distributor, with 11 assists in her past two games.,It has been five years since Connecticut’s last title, as long of a gap as the program has had between championships since it won its first in 1995. .,Arizona’s first trip to the Final Four has come courtesy of Aari McDonald, its star senior guard, who poured in 64 points in wins over Texas A&M and Indiana this week and has been an unstoppable force on both ends of the floor.,“When you know, you know you’re feeling it,” McDonald told reporters after the game. “I wasn’t doing too well in the regular season, taking bad shots and stuff. But now I’m really just taking what the defense is giving me.”,While McDonald, the Pac-12 player of the year, has led the way offensively, forward Trinity Baptiste has given the team some much-needed size and even contributed a double-double against Indiana. The Wildcats play a relentless, high-energy defense that forces a lot of turnovers, especially against teams that underestimate them.,“We just need this confidence and momentum going into UConn,” McDonald said. “UConn, we already know what they’re about: powerhouse, well-coached, skillful players. But hey, I got my chances with my teammates. Ride or die, I’m going to war with them.”,When South Carolina won its first national title in 2017, the Gamecocks had the best player in the country in A’ja Wilson, the 2020 W.N.B.A. most valuable player. Coach Dawn Staley’s team looked ready to claim another trophy last season, going 32-1 behind a group of young talent that — while it didn’t yet have, S.C. — looked good enough to deserve one.,Then the pandemic hit, and the Gamecocks’ momentum was (temporarily) halted. This season, South Carolina lost four times — all to ranked teams, and while still showing some of the immaturity of its young core.,“When we got knocked down four times this season, they got back up stronger, and I like that,” Staley said after Tuesday’s win against Texas sent her team back to the Final Four. “They haven’t even scratched the surface of how good they can be. We’re happy, but we’re not done yet.”,The 6-foot-5 center Aliyah Boston typically fuels both the defense and the offense, scoring efficiently under the basket, but increasingly South Carolina’s quick guards have stepped into starring roles. The junior Destanni Henderson and the sophomore Zia Cooke are scoring threats anywhere on the floor, and the Gamecocks are playing their best basketball of the season.,Stanford breezed through its first three tournament games, barely breaking a sweat as they hit 43 3-pointers. Then they met up with a scrappy Louisville team on Tuesday that spent more than half of the game in the lead; at one point in the third quarter, Louisville led by 14 points.,But Stanford rallied behind its typically balanced shooting. Bench players like the 6-foot-5 sophomore Ashten Prechtel, who played only 16 minutes but made all six of her shots, offered key contributions when shots by Stanford’s senior leader, Kiana Williams, weren’t falling.,Stanford, the top overall seed in this year’s tournament, regained its footing because it has so many players who can shoot. Even in a game when it wasn’t scoring confidently, the Cardinal still made seven 3-pointers.,“I just had to change my mentality,” Williams said after Stanford rallied to claim its 14th Final Four appearance under ,. “I was forcing things — I think I wanted it too bad. Once I got that first shot to go in, it started going from there.”,Facing a big tournament test against Louisville has likely better equipped the Cardinal what’s to come against South Carolina on Friday. Now, the challenge for Stanford will be whether its defense can stifle a team with as many skillful shooters as its own.",sports

But on the first try, fans weren’t in a hurry to pack the stands. Those who did make the trip saw the Rangers lose, 4-0.,Eager to see baseball again, Sara Lambin, 42, drove about three hours from Georgetown, Texas, with her two kids for Monday night’s game — the first time she and her family had seen live baseball in more than a year.,Lambin said she saw a dozen spring training games in Surprise, Ariz., last year before M.L.B., like all other sports leagues, shut down.,“It’s almost like a lull. We’re just ready for it,” Lambin said, sitting 17 rows behind home plate.,In coming to the exhibition game, Lambin said she hoped to beat what will likely be a much larger crowd when the Rangers play their home opener against the Toronto Blue Jays on April 5.,“If this were to fill up, I don’t think I’d be that comfortable,” Lambin said. “We would leave.”,Others, like Porter Burns, 22, were less concerned with the size of crowd.,“In Texas, I have the freedom,” Burns said as he watched batting practice before the game. “Because I’m vaccinated, I’m not afraid at all.”,Even though there were no capacity restrictions, Burns said he felt the Rangers still had too many rules in place, lamenting that he wasn’t allowed to bring his backpack into the ballpark.,Still, he said he appreciated a chance to see the ballpark before most fans did.,“I wanted to come out here early just to see it without all the people,” Burns said.,While the Rangers played all 30 home games without fans last season, Monday’s game did not mark the first time Globe Life Field was open to spectators. Last summer, the park hosted ,. In the fall, it was open to about 11,500 fans per game for the National League Championship Series and the World Series. In December, it hosted the National Finals Rodeo and a holiday lights display.,Texas has been fully open since March 10 after , mandate and announced that any business could open to 100 percent.,“Make no mistake, Covid-19 has not disappeared,” Abbott said in a statement earlier this month, adding that Texans should continue to observe safe practices. “Each person has a role to play in their own personal safety and the safety of others.”,A number of precautions remained in place Monday night at Globe Life Field, just as they will at other major league parks: Masks were required for all fans, unless they were eating or drinking. Hand-sanitizing stations were available throughout the ballpark. Concessions were cashless, and stickers reading “Do Your Part Stay 6 Feet Apart” were spread throughout the ballpark at concession stands.,Watching the game from behind first base, Travis Scarangello, 27, said he trusted other fans to take the appropriate precautions.,“As long as people are wearing masks, I don’t think I’m going to get sick,” Scarangello said, adding that he drove more than three hours from Austin to see Monday night’s game.,Keeping a safe distance was easier in some parts of the park than others. Some sections were completely empty, while dozens of fans sat together in portions of right field.,Bryan Dunne, 28, said he felt the safety protocols were a small price to pay to see baseball again in person.,“We had a year off,” Dunne said, adding that before the pandemic he would typically attend 20 games per season. “I’m just happy to be back.”,Aside from the Rangers’ home opener, teams across M.L.B. will not be , to start the season. The Yankees , and the Mets in front of about 8,400 — as long as fans present proof of full vaccination or a negative coronavirus test taken at least 72 hours before games.,The , will open to just over 42 percent of capacity, or 21,000 fans, while the , will allow only 1,000 fans.,On a night with temperatures in the 70s, the retractable roof at Globe Life was open, allowing a breezy south wind to blow through.

Men’s Final Four: An Early Look,"With some blowouts and plenty of busted brackets, we have arrived at the , men’s Final Four. And the semifinal matchups promise some good story lines with a Texas intrastate clash and a top-seeded juggernaut facing one of the last teams selected to be in the field of 68.,The four that remain: , and ,. Here’s a look at each team’s strengths and weaknesses ahead of their semifinals on Saturday.,After its 81-72 win against Arkansas, Baylor (28-3) made it to its first Final Four since 1950 and the Bears look as ready as ever. The Bears, the top seed in the South region, are a strong defensive team that is going to give Houston its most challenging matchup in the tournament. The Bears also have great 3-point shooting — the best in the men’s game at 41 percent.,Baylor is led by three skilled guards — Jared Butler, MaCio Teague and Davion Mitchell — who combine to score 46.5 of the team’s 83 average points per game.,The important thing for Baylor is to take advantage of its shooting strengths. Houston’s defense is a hard one to get past, but Baylor has the shooters to do it. They just have to make the shots.,Baylor struggles with turnovers, averaging 11.7 per game. That carelessness with the ball sometimes hurts the Bears, like it did when they allowed Arkansas to make a comeback from 17 points down. Houston’s elite and quick defense could take advantage if that happens again.,Defense, defense, defense — No. 2-seeded Houston (28-3) out of the Midwest region is great at it. The Cougars are making their first Final Four appearance since 1984 and looking like a team ready and able to stop any offense in its path. Houston is able to close in quick and force turnovers, making it the second best defense in men’s Division I, holding opponents to just 57.6 points per game.,Houston is led by Quentin Grimes, a transfer from Kansas who has found much success with the Cougars. Grimes averages 18 points and 5.8 rebounds and is key to the team’s offensive strategy.,The Cougars are also a great rebounding team, which will be particularly important against Baylor’s 3-point shooting to take those second-chance points away from the Bears.,Houston has to be able to either set the pace of the game or keep up with Baylor on the offensive end. It is clearly a strong team when it comes to preventing its opponents from making shots, but Houston still must make its own.,Grimes is important for the Cougars offense, but he isn’t all of it, and can’t be if Houston expects to beat Baylor.,Undefeated No. 1-seeded Gonzaga (30-0) is not the team to make mistakes around. The Bulldogs, who easily won the West region, are dominant because they take advantage of turnover opportunities to score. This team also shares the ball well, averaging 18.6 assists.,The Bulldogs also score an average of 91.8 points per game — the most of any men’s team in Division I. They are extremely efficient, push the pace and can keep up with any kind of defense.,Gonzaga is led by Corey Kispert, who averages 19 points. Close behind is Drew Timme, averaging 18.9 points and 7.2 rebounds — he has scored a combined 45 points in the last two games. He is one of the most multifaceted players in college basketball and is one of several pro prospects among the Bulldogs.,No one has shown itself able to really threaten the Zags in their attempt to be the first undefeated champion since Indiana in 1976. It will be a big challenge for U.C.L.A. to get in the way.,Gonzaga is good, if not great, at most things. It made Southern California look completely outclassed on Tuesday night and showed some well-earned swagger in the process. But U.C.L.A. has toppled plenty of other teams in this tournament, including top-seeded Michigan.,U.C.L.A., a No. 11 seed who had to play a First Four game just to enter the round of 64, is easily the surprise of this semifinal quartet after winning the East region. Coach Mick Cronin has no players with previous N.C.A.A. tournament experience on his roster. The Bruins are here for the first time since 2008, and are the second team to go from a play-in game to the Final Four.,The Bruins have had quite a path here, playing in two overtime games, including in the First Four against Michigan State. Upsetting Michigan, 51-49, they found a way to force the Wolverines into turnovers and take advantage. If the Bruins have proved anything in this tournament, it is resilience.,U.C.L.A. is a talented 3-point shooting team at 37.2 percent. Johnny Juzang averages 15 points and 4.1 rebounds, and he has continued to contribute in big ways even while contending with an ankle injury during the postseason. He scored 28 points in the round of 8 win.,“Nobody picked this, nobody believed in us,” Cronin said in a sideline interview after the win against Michigan. “That’s how we like it.”,The U.C.L.A. bench had no points in its win against Michigan. Its lack of depth could be a big problem against the versatile Bulldogs. If the Bruins don’t get contributions beyond their starters, they will have an even steeper climb keeping up with Gonzaga’s quick offense.,The Bruins have also struggled from the free throw line in their last few games which could cause problems, especially if they are being forced to drive instead of taking shots from behind the arc.,It is no secret that the Bruins are going to have to play the best game of their season to compete with Gonzaga, but they have been full of surprises this postseason.",sports
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/us/supreme-court-ncaa.html,Supreme Court Seems Ready to Back Payments to Student-Athletes,"WASHINGTON — Justices across the ideological spectrum teamed up during , on Wednesday to voice skepticism about the N.C.A.A.’s position that it could bar relatively modest payments to student-athletes in the name of amateurism despite the antitrust laws. But some of the same justices also seemed worried about opening the floodgates to further challenges.,Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh said that “the antitrust laws should not be a cover for exploitation of the student-athletes,” adding that he doubted that college sports fans understood amateurism to require it.,“To pay no salaries to the workers who are making the schools billions of dollars on the theory that consumers want the schools to pay their workers nothing,” he said, seems “entirely circular and even somewhat disturbing.”,Justice Clarence Thomas noted that other participants in college sports are paid enormous sums. “It just strikes me as odd that the coaches’ salaries have ballooned,” he said, “and they’re in the amateur ranks, as are the players.”,By contrast, Justice Elena Kagan said, colleges and universities have used their combined market power “to fix athletic salaries at extremely low levels, far lower than what the market would set if it were allowed to operate.”,A ruling in favor of the education-related payments at issue in the case would be among the largest breakthroughs to date in the effort to pay college athletes, which has gained momentum in recent years as one state after another considers proposals to allow them to profit from their fame. It would also be yet another blow to the N.C.A.A., which has found its business model increasingly under siege and has argued that payments would effectively professionalize students.,Though there seemed to be something like a consensus for the payments at issue, several justices said they were concerned that such a ruling would prompt a deluge of other challenges.,“How do we know,” Justice Sonia Sotomayor asked, “that we’re not just destroying the game as it exists?”,Justice Stephen G. Breyer added, “I worry a lot about judges getting into the business of deciding how amateur sports should be run.”,Last year, a , that the N.C.A.A. was not free to limit benefits tied to education for Division I football and basketball players. The decision allowed payments for things like musical instruments, scientific equipment, postgraduate scholarships, tutoring, study abroad, academic awards and internships. It did not permit the outright payment of salaries.,The court rejected the N.C.A.A.’s argument that compensating athletes would alienate sports fans who prize students’ amateur status. “Uncapping certain education-related benefits would preserve consumer demand for college athletics just as well as the challenged rules do,” Chief Judge Sidney R. Thomas wrote for a unanimous three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco.,“Such benefits are easily distinguishable from professional salaries,” he wrote, as they are linked to education and could be provided in kind rather than in cash. “The record furnishes ample support,” Judge Thomas added, “that the provision of education-related benefits has not and will not repel college sports fans.”,At the argument on Wednesday, Seth P. Waxman, a lawyer for the N.C.A.A., said “these new allowances are akin to professional salaries.”,Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. responded that some of the payments the association already allows had a similar character.,“Schools can pay up to $50,000 for a $10 million insurance policy to protect student-athletes for future earnings,” he said. “Now that sounds very much like pay for play.”,Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., drawing on briefs supporting the players, painted a bleak picture of athletes’ lives and futures.,“They face training requirements that leave little time or energy for study, constant pressure to put sports above study, pressure to drop out of hard majors and hard classes, really shockingly low graduation rates,” he said. “Only a tiny percentage ever go on to make any money in professional sports.”,“So the argument is they are recruited, they’re used up, and then they’re cast aside without even a college degree,” he said. “How can this be defended in the name of amateurism?”,Mr. Waxman said the alternative would be worse. “If you allow them to be paid,” he said, “they will be spending even more time on their athletics and devoting even less attention to academics.”,Justice Alito said the athletes were already paid. “They get lower admission standards,” he said. “They get tuition, room and board, and other things. That’s a form of pay. So the distinction is not whether they’re going to be paid. It’s the form in which they’re going to be paid and how much they’re going to be paid.”,Mr. Waxman said paid internships posed particular hazards because they could involve unlimited sums.,Justice Sotomayor responded that the N.C.A.A. remained free to set limits. “If you think that internships should be related in some way to the educational experience,” she said, “you could pass rules to that effect.”,Justice Thomas said that paying athletes “sounds fine for the upper-level schools, whether it’s, you know, Alabama, Ohio State and Nebraska.” But he said he was worried that “the bigger schools would begin to cherry-pick with the transfer portal the athletes from the lower schools simply because they’re able to afford this income.”,Jeffrey L. Kessler, a lawyer for Shawne Alston, a former West Virginia University running back, and other student-athletes challenging the N.C.A.A.’s rules, said that “those schools don’t compete now.”,“Alabama pays its weight coaches $700,000 a year,” he said. “None of those small schools can do that.”,The Supreme Court last considered how antitrust laws applied to the association in 1984, ruling that its restrictions on television coverage of college football games were unlawful. But the decision, ,, included an influential passage on student-athletes.,“The N.C.A.A. plays a critical role in the maintenance of a revered tradition of amateurism in college sports,” , wrote for the majority. “There can be no question but that it needs ample latitude to play that role, or that the preservation of the student-athlete in higher education adds richness and diversity to intercollegiate athletics and is entirely consistent with the goals of” the antitrust laws.,The Biden administration filed a brief supporting the athletes in the new case, ,, No. 20-512, saying that the Ninth Circuit had struck the right balance.,“The court was focused on legitimate educational expenses,” Elizabeth B. Prelogar, the acting solicitor general, told the justices on Wednesday.,Besides the coronavirus pandemic, no issue has recently demanded more of the N.C.A.A.’s attention than the rights of student-athletes, especially whether they should be able to profit from their fame. College sports executives have long feared that loosening age-old rules would open a different array of challenges, but they have faced mounting pressure over the past few years from Congress and many of the nation’s statehouses.,Most crucially, a Florida law that directly challenges the N.C.A.A.’s policies is scheduled to take effect this summer, and California legislators are considering a proposal to speed up a similar measure there.,Although the N.C.A.A. has vowed to rewrite its rules, it delayed final approval over the winter after the Trump administration’s Justice Department raised misgivings. And Congress has not rushed to give the association the kind of political and legal cover it craves.,The argument on Wednesday had some lighter moments, as when Mr. Waxman mistakenly addressed Justice Thomas as “Mr. Chief Justice.”,“Thank you for the promotion,” Justice Thomas said.,The chief justice responded that the job was taken. “There’s no opening, Mr. Waxman,” he said.,Alan Blinder, contributed reporting.",sports
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/sports/basketball/nba-trades.html,N.B.A. Trade Deadline Fallout: Uncertainty for the Lakers and Raptors,"All the trades have been made. This season’s roster shuffling, barring a free-agent signing or three coming soon, is complete.,It’s time, then, to take a tour around the league for some post-trade deadline fallout, rumbles, analysis and storytelling:,One of the Lakers’ prime off-season acquisitions, Schröder featured in trade talks with the Toronto Raptors for Kyle Lowry. The discussions broke down over the Lakers’ unwillingness to include the blossoming Talen Horton-Tucker in a deal for Lowry, 35, who will become a free agent at season’s end.,Schröder, 27, was available because of the gulf between player and team in contract extension talks. He has rebuffed extension offers from the Lakers in the range of $80 million over four years, according to two people familiar with the discussions who were not authorized to discuss them publicly. Schröder’s efficiency has slumped since his productive 2019-20 season in Oklahoma City, but he is said to be seeking more robust compensation in free agency this off-season. His previous biggest deal was a four-year, $70 million contract extension signed with Atlanta in October 2016.,More surprising than Schröder’s availability was the Lakers’ willingness to package him with Kentavious Caldwell-Pope after Caldwell-Pope was such a key contributor to last season’s championship — and when Caldwell-Pope, like Anthony Davis and LeBron James, is represented by the influential agent Rich Paul.,Masai Ujiri, Toronto’s president of basketball operations, is also in the final year of his contract. There were strong rumbles last summer that Ujiri, General Manager Bobby Webster and Coach Nick Nurse were all poised to receive new five-year deals from the Raptors. Nurse and Webster have since signed long-term contracts, but Ujiri has repeatedly deflected questions about his future.,Like Lowry, Ujiri has been regarded by fans and the organization as Raptors royalty since the team’s championship run in 2018-19. It is widely presumed in league circles that only an overwhelming offer in a highly desirable market could lure him away from the influence and affection he has amassed in Toronto. Yet these many months without a deal and Webster’s rising profile as a natural successor have raised the question: How much longer will Ujiri be running the Raptors?,For a Canadian public edgy about the prospect of Lowry and Ujiri potentially hitting free agency at the same time, this counter question should provide some measure of comfort: Where would Ujiri go?,He was known to have interest in the Knicks’ job before James L. Dolan, the Knicks’ owner, abruptly decided last spring to abandon the pursuit of Ujiri to instead hire Leon Rose, a prominent former player agent. A worthy post-Toronto landing spot is difficult to pinpoint unless the Washington Wizards, who vehemently denied being interested after the Raptors’ championship, amend that stance.,Some around the league, though, have wondered about a potential down-the-road option that does not yet exist. The group heading expansion efforts in Seattle features the longtime sports executive Tim Leiweke, who brought Ujiri to Toronto for the 2013-14 season.,The recent bargain signings of Blake Griffin and LaMarcus Aldridge, after the January acquisition of James Harden, have further entrenched the Nets as villains. Coach Steve Nash leaned in to the criticism with some humor when he spoke to reporters on Monday, letting out ,.,“It’s kind of funny to me, because for the last couple years, all I’ve heard is how bad I am,” Griffin said. “You sign with this team and everybody’s like, ‘That’s not fair.’”,The volume on complaints surely would have been higher had the Nets been successful in their attempts to trade the injured Spencer Dinwiddie for a wing player. Among the options they explored, I’m told, was sending Dinwiddie to Golden State for Kelly Oubre. Golden State rejected those overtures because it is still desperate to make the playoffs. While numerous Oubre trade scenarios came up, Golden State was not going to trade him for someone who couldn’t help the team in the short term.,“I think a lot of people thought he might be available, but we value him, too, as evidenced by not trading him,” Bob Myers, Golden State’s president of basketball operations, said of Oubre on Friday.,The Bulls, Nuggets and Magic are known (and sometimes criticized) for not pursuing trades as aggressively as fans would like. So you applaud Denver for making the most ambitious move in the West by trading for the Magic’s Aaron Gordon, which not only enhances the Nuggets’ ability to win the conference but also shouldn’t hinder them in the Bradley Beal sweepstakes if (when?) Washington reaches the point of making Beal available.,The Nikola Vucevic trade, furthermore, was bold for both Orlando and Chicago. The Bulls, who had no All-Stars when Chicago hosted last season’s All-Star Game, packaged two future first-round picks and Wendell Carter Jr. to get Vucevic, who played in his second All-Star Game this season — as did a first-timer: Chicago’s Zach LaVine.,The Magic turned heads, too, by initiating a total tear down and trading Vucevic, Gordon and Evan Fournier after they had been pretty convincing in the weeks leading up to the deadline that Vucevic was staying put. With Vucevic, at age 30, in the midst of his most productive season and seemingly getting better offensively, I thought he was the one Magic pillar they were bound to keep to lead younger players like Jonathan Isaac and Markelle Fultz when they return from injury. Several teams were convinced Orlando wouldn’t part with Vucevic unless it received a substantial offer; Chicago duly put more on the table than anticipated.,Trevor Ariza and Andre Drummond, two of the league’s most prized veterans as title contenders fortify their rosters for the playoffs, worked out in the same Miami gym in recent months.,Ariza and Drummond are among the prominent players who have been practicing at The Miami Perimeter with Stanley Remy, who trains Miami’s Jimmy Butler. Ariza made it his base while on leave awaiting a trade from the Oklahoma City Thunder, who dealt him to the Heat on March 17. Drummond trained in the same gym after he and the Cleveland Cavaliers agreed in February to seek a trade. When the Cavaliers couldn’t find a desirable deal, they negotiated a buyout with Drummond, who signed on Sunday with the Lakers.,Other veterans who have been spotted in Remy’s gym include the veteran center Greg Monroe and, in a surprise, Amar’e Stoudemire. As a , for the Nets this season, Stoudemire, 38, works with the team at home. Yet he does not travel with the Nets and has made occasional trips to Miami to see family when the team is on the road. Stoudemire has also been pursuing an M.B.A. through online classes at the University of Miami., — @MoneyDre123 from Twitter, — @MoneyDre123 from Twitter, You sent me multiple tweets in the past few days that hit on two newsy topics, so let’s address both.,Surprising as it was to see Aldridge choose to join the Nets over Miami, it is no surprise that the Nets have made multiple signings. A free-spending title contender will always hold appeal to former All-Stars like Aldridge and Griffin, who not only covet the chance to compete for a championship but are also trying to rebuild their value as they head to free agency in the off-season.,The surprise here is the development of Brown and Claxton. I don’t remember many touting them to both become dependable rotation players so quickly — whether that’s because of faster-than-anticipated development or the natural benefit of the extra space created by offensive threats like Harden, Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant. Or both.,This was the fourth consecutive season in which deadline day delivered a double-digit number of trades, and I expect the trend to continue. I can still vividly remember deadline day in 2000, when Atlanta’s dealing Anthony Johnson to Orlando was the only sad little trade to go down, but this is a different N.B.A.,You have to go back to 2009 for the last deadline day that featured fewer than eight trades. Although that certainly doesn’t mean we’re going to see landscape-changers every year, I will concede that last week’s activity exceeded even optimistic expectations like mine — even with Toronto’s Kyle Lowry staying put., — Johnny Tse (Hong Kong), Last seen in the league playing a minor role off the Lakers’ bench during their championship run last summer, Waiters is another one of the free agents who has been working out at the Miami Perimeter gym discussed in this week’s lead item.,Though that doesn’t mean that Waiters, 29, will get another N.B.A. shot, Brandon Knight has also been working out there and, according to a report from my longtime colleague ,, recently earned an audition with the Milwaukee Bucks.,Among the factors working against Waiters: There are a lot of proven N.B.A. players competing for roster spots. I asked a noted salary-cap guru and transaction tracker, @KeithSmithNBA, to help me compile a list of well-known free agents without regard to position. A partial list from what he came up with: DeMarcus Cousins, Jamal Crawford, Yogi Ferrell, John Henson, Rondae Hollis-Jefferson, Damian Jones, Mfiondu Kabengele, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, Jeremy Lin, Kyle O’Quinn, James Nunnally, Jabari Parker, Andre Roberson, Iman Shumpert, J.R. Smith and Isaiah Thomas., — Bruce Klutchko (New York), I love hearing how much you enjoy it, and we are very much on the same page on this, but perhaps that didn’t come through as clearly as I hoped in ,.,Various coaches and players have said that the advent of baseball-style series this season, in which teams play host to the same opponent in consecutive games to reduce travel, has been a factor in lessening home-court advantage in today’s N.B.A. Pinpointing exactly how much is not possible, but there are presumed sleep and rest benefits for players on visiting teams when they get to stay in one city longer. Put it on the list as a factor in the road teams’ favor along with the more inviting arena atmospheres for visiting teams given the reduced crowds (or empty buildings).,We will keep tracking the numbers all season, but I don’t see how anyone can dispute that playing the same opponent twice in a row, especially with a night off in between, results in more favorable conditions for the visiting team.,The worst might be behind the N.B.A. in terms of dealing with the coronavirus — at least during the regular season. If the league can get through two more days, it will have made it through the entire month of March without postponing a single game in accordance with the league’s health and safety protocols. The league postponed , in December, January and February because at least one team could not field the minimum required eight players in uniform because of either positive coronavirus tests or contact tracing.,The Nets and the two Los Angeles teams (Lakers and Clippers) are the only teams to avoid a game postponement according to the league’s health and safety protocols.,Twenty-seven of the league’s 30 teams made at least one trade during the season, including 23 last Thursday on deadline day. The only teams that did not make an in-season deal: Memphis, Minnesota and the Los Angeles Lakers.,The Knicks were the first team to surpass their projected over/under win total, according to ,. The Knicks’ over/under was a league-low 21.5 victories; they entered Tuesday’s play tied with the Charlotte Hornets for fourth in the Eastern Conference at 24-23.,Blake Griffin and LaMarcus Aldridge, both represented by Excel Sports, surrendered an estimated $19.1 million in combined salary to become unrestricted free agents and sign veteran minimum contracts to join the Nets. Griffin (who gave back $13.3 million to Detroit) and Aldridge ($5.8 million to San Antonio) have joined DeAndre Jordan, Jeff Green and Nicolas Claxton in a suddenly crowded Nets frontcourt. With Joe Harris no less a fixture in the Nets’ closing lineup than their big-name stars, five big men are vying for limited minutes.",sports

Should he be? It all depends on who you ask.,On Tuesday night in Montreal, with McDavid’s Edmonton Oilers already trailing the Canadiens by 3-0 in the first period, the star center laid a crushing hit on Montreal’s Jesperi Kotkaniemi.,Breaking out of the Canadiens end, just over the blue line, Kotkaniemi dropped the puck behind him to left wing Paul Byron and peeled off across center ice. McDavid, racing up on Byron to the left, crossed in front and appeared to target Kotkaniemi even though he no longer had the puck.,A split-second before they collided, McDavid drove his elbow into Kotkaniemi’s shoulder, and then connected with his jaw.,Here’s a wide angle view.,Kotkaniemi, a 20-year-old center fell to the ice in a heap, clutching his face.,McDavid was given a two-minute minor penalty for roughing.,And Twitter in Canada, which until that point had predominantly been focused on the coronavirus pandemic’s , and the plucky Toronto Blue Jays’ , this week, turned its attention to a discussion for and against McDavid, complete with calls for suspensions and fines and Zapruder-film , of the hit.,But McDavid, who leads the N.H.L. with 63 points and ranks second in goals with 21, also had his defenders.,McDavid is known for his , and , — his goals often must be watched repeatedly in slow motion to fully appreciate — but he was visibly frustrated early on last night. His mood had perhaps carried over from the previous evening, a 3-2 overtime win against the Toronto Maple Leafs, when at the end of the second period McDavid skated over to an official and , animatedly: “No penalty? None? Every time!”,The Canadiens hadn’t played since March 20 because of the league’s coronavirus protocols, but they were fresh and dominated the Oilers. Kotkaniemi scored 18 seconds into the game. In the second period, McDavid had a goal disallowed after the Oilers were ruled offside. Montreal won, 4-0.,“I didn’t think anything of it; it was just a normal night.” McDavid said in response to a question from a Le Journal de Montreal reporter about having “an emotional night” that included the hit on Kotkaniemi and his disallowed goal.,Some were sympathetic to McDavid, and the plight of highly skilled generational stars like him whose talents can be routinely hampered by grabs, hits and illegal holds that go uncalled by the officials. Hockey has had , for years.,Still, some argued McDavid ,, or suggested that the N.H.L. department of player safety had sometimes failed to apply standards and discipline consistently. Many argued a less-prominent player committing the same hit would have earned harsher in-game discipline and even a suspension.,The N.H.L. has yet to weigh in, but it is expected to address the incident. McDavid is the , at $12.5 million a year, and perhaps its biggest star.,He was suspended in February 2019 for an illegal check to the head of Islanders defenseman Nick Leddy. In that instance, Leddy was attempting to play the puck and McDavid’s shoulder ,.,The department of player safety does not rule a player a repeat offender if 18 months have passed since their last infraction. McDavid’s latest hit falls well outside that window.",sports

But his 2019 speech to a roomful of antitrust experts at the Robert F. Kennedy Building signaled a shift in Washington. Less than a decade earlier, Huma recalled, federal law enforcement officials had told him that the capital’s political climate did not support action against the , Now he was being invited to speak on Pennsylvania Avenue.,“More and more people find what the N.C.A.A. is doing is just patently unacceptable in terms of their treatment of athletes,” said Senator Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey, who played football at Stanford University and has championed a proposal that would ,. The association, he added, was “not realizing the moral view of this has really grown or shifted.”,The N.C.A.A. is embroiled in perhaps the most crucial stretch of its long relationship with Washington, where top government officials have increasingly voiced doubts about the management and restrictions of college sports.,On Wednesday, the 115th anniversary of the N.C.A.A.’s founding under pressure from President Theodore Roosevelt, the Supreme Court will hear the association’s appeal in ,. This summer, around the time the justices could announce their ruling, a Florida law is scheduled to take effect and allow players to profit off their fame, disrupting the uniform rules that have regulated college athletics for generations.,Those potentially seminal developments were brewing before this month’s N.C.A.A. basketball tournaments demonstrated , between the men and women competing in them, prompting new outrage from members of Congress. And, encouraged by Huma, star athletes at both tournaments , to what they condemned as overly restrictive N.C.A.A. rules that have remained in place even as the industry’s financial might swelled.,The confluence of events could ultimately push Washington toward a few outcomes, including national protections for student-athletes or sustained scrutiny on the N.C.A.A. from Capitol Hill and the Justice Department. What lawmakers say is already clear, though, is that the N.C.A.A.’s political standing has eroded in recent years, diminished by protracted internal debates and bipartisan, coast-to-coast pressure for changes that benefit athletes.,N.C.A.A. officials contend that they are still a force in Washington and that they are committed to new rules to allow players more financial opportunities, especially through social media platforms where many athletes command large followings. Change has been slow, however, because of the association’s byzantine design and because the Justice Department, in the waning days of the Trump administration, , about the N.C.A.A.'s plans.,The association’s president, Mark Emmert, acknowledged in an interview this month that there were “significant concerns about some of the dynamics in college sports right now, and that’s neither inappropriate nor unfair.” But he bristled at more than a year’s worth of assessments by current and former lawmakers, regulators and college sports executives that the N.C.A.A. had become less formidable in the capital.,“We’re talking about these issues, working them through, trying to make sure everybody understands the views of the universities that are the members of the association,” said Emmert, who noted that he had spoken with a senator perhaps an hour earlier. “Are there disagreements? Of course. Are we open to the input, thoughts and ideas of members of Congress? Of course.”,The N.C.A.A. has long been a favored target for frustrated fans, incredulous boosters and, from time to time, senators. But only in the last few years has the association also become such a lasting political target, a status it has been especially unable to shake since 2019, when , to allow players to pursue endorsement deals and hire agents. The measure, scheduled to take effect in 2023, passed unanimously and amounted to a direct challenge to the N.C.A.A.’s restrictions on players.,After California’s move, elected officials elsewhere — some motivated by moral outrage, others perhaps by the prospect of losing a prized recruit to a California school, and just about all sensing an issue that defied traditional partisan lines — joined the chorus demanding new rules. Confronted with ,, the N.C.A.A. shifted its focus toward Washington and promised its own changes.,There has been significant reason to seek federal intervention: Different rules from one state to another, N.C.A.A. officials warned, would allow some universities to dangle better benefits toward recruits and give certain schools unfair advantages. But some in college sports also believed that buttoned-up Washington could be something of a safe harbor, especially compared with restive state capitals where the N.C.A.A.’s concerns were being ,.,In Washington, though, some prominent lawmakers were wary after years of delays and mixed signals from college sports leaders. They were hardly ready to shut out the N.C.A.A., many said, but the association would not go unquestioned.,“There’s no question that the N.C.A.A. has a lot of power,” Representative Lori Trahan, Democrat of Massachusetts, who played volleyball at Georgetown University. “I know my office and I have had plenty of communication with them. But what you’re seeing right now is a bipartisan recognition that the current system is broken, it has been for a long time, and it needs to be fixed.”,Lawmakers, she added, feel “like they’ve got a role to play in all of this. Would we have liked the N.C.A.A. to come up with a proposal that met the need and met the inequity? Of course.”,Senator Chris Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, noted that it was “kind of impossible for them to represent the interests of both Auburn and Amherst,” but suggested that the sprawl of the N.C.A.A, which includes about 1,100 colleges and universities, left its message muddled and inconsistent.,“The power of the status quo in this debate is going to flow directly through the schools and conferences, not the N.C.A.A., and I think the N.C.A.A. has made it pretty clear that they are not able to articulate a consensus point of view but that they’re also not terribly interested in policing student safety and student economic rights,” he said.,Although the N.C.A.A. has a lobbying presence in Washington, powerful leagues have increasingly stepped up their efforts to shape policy. Federal records show that the five most influential leagues in college sports — the Atlantic Coast, Big Ten, Big 12, Pac-12 and Southeastern conferences — combined to spend more than $1.7 million on lobbying in 2020, up from $300,000 in 2019.,Emmert, a former professor of political science, suggested it was a savvy approach, not a measure of the N.C.A.A.’s clout, for leagues to try to lobby officials who might be particularly affectionate toward their brand-name schools. Others in college sports agreed that a conference-driven lobbying strategy could certainly be good politics, but that it also reflected serious concerns about the N.C.A.A.’s influence.,“The N.C.A.A. blue disc is toxic in some quarters in Washington, D.C., but I would suggest that not all of that is fair,” said Bob Bowlsby, the Big 12 commissioner, referring to the association’s logo. “The analogy with Congress is spot on: Everybody loves their congressman but hates Congress, and everybody loves their school, but they hate the N.C.A.A.”,With the N.C.A.A. sometimes proving “a problematic brand,” Bowlsby said, “we, obviously, want to have our own representation.”,That notwithstanding, the N.C.A.A. still has powerful allies in Washington. Until recently, Veterans Affairs Secretary Denis R. McDonough and Vivek H. Murthy, the surgeon general, sat on the association’s board. When McDonough left the board last year, Robert M. Gates, who led the Pentagon for parts of the George W. Bush and Obama administrations, took his place.,Legislators are careful not to question the personal integrity of N.C.A.A. leaders. But in a twist that many government and sports officials laughingly acknowledge, the United States Congress has wound up complaining about another organization’s sluggishness.,Some lawmakers say that the N.C.A.A.’s current proposal, which would allow students a regulated opportunity to profit off their fame, falls far short of expectations.,“There are a lot of people who were sort of stunned by how little they offered, or were appalled by how little they offered,” Booker said. “And it may have confirmed a lot of skepticism about the institution’s ability to govern itself, to reform itself.”,Although Democratic proposals have drawn most of the attention, especially now that the party controls both chambers of Congress and the White House, Republicans have offered measures that would give student-athletes greater autonomy but impose more limited checks on the N.C.A.A.’s power.,Senator Jerry Moran of Kansas, who led , that drew Bowlsby, Emmert and Huma, did not respond to an interview request, nor did Representative Anthony Gonzalez of Ohio, who introduced a bipartisan proposal during the last Congress and was the only Republican lawmaker to address the N.C.A.A. convention in January.,“The thing that I’m always balancing in my head is, how do we extend student-athlete rights as far as we can without jeopardizing the system over all?” Gonzalez, who played football at Ohio State University, said in that appearance.,A crucial question now is the timing of any federal action. Some legislators, like Booker and Trahan, believe that the emergence of new state laws will encourage Congress to act quickly, perhaps as soon as this summer.,But lawmakers said the White House had shown only limited interest so far, and Murphy predicted the matter would not go before the full Senate before the end of 2021.,“Realistically, this is not on the top 10 list of the House or the Senate right now,” said Murphy, who said he was unbothered by the possibility of varied state laws coming online.,And while the Justice Department sided with the former athletes whose case, N.C.A.A. v. Alston, No. 20-512, will go before the Supreme Court on Wednesday, the department is widely seen as unlikely to take additional quick action on college sports in the opening months of a new administration. Even before the transfer of power, the government was not close to bringing an antitrust case against the N.C.A.A., according to two former law enforcement officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential deliberations. The department declined to make Richard Powers, the acting assistant attorney general for its antitrust division, available for an interview.,“We were created through a political process,” Donald M. Remy, the N.C.A.A.’s chief legal officer, said. “It has been the case since then that the public trust of college sports has drawn the interest of federal, regional, state and local policymakers.”,On that much, at least, the N.C.A.A. and its critics and skeptics agree.",sports

The Zags, tucked away on the dry, desolate side of the Cascade Range, have long since grown out of their glass slippers — they travel by charter, produce a pipeline of N.B.A. talent and have won more N.C.A.A. tournament games than anyone in the country since 2015.,Still, the spotlight doesn’t always find its way to the boys from Spokane.,Even on the cusp of a landmark run, the Zags found themselves on the undercard Tuesday night, relegated to the opening act for a pair of blue bloods, U.C.L.A. and Michigan.,No matter, Gonzaga quickly carved up what had been a flaming-hot Southern California team, 85-66, to win the West regional final at Lucas Oil Stadium. The Zags (30-0) will advance to play 11th-seeded U.C.L.A., which stunned top-seeded Michigan, 51-49, to become the second team to reach the Final Four while coming out of the First Four as one of the last at-large selections in the 68-team field.,The Bruins got 28 points from Johnny Juzang, and held Michigan without a basket for the final 5 minutes, 22 seconds, including a 3-pointer by Franz Wagner that bounced off the rim at the buzzer.,As it did, the Bruins poured off the bench and onto the floor, celebrating a wild finish to an untidy game that put them in the Final Four for the first time in 13 years and kept alive a chase for a 12th national title.,Standing in the way is the team that supplanted the Bruins, with their rich but long ago history, as the best in the West.,For all of Gonzaga’s success since it burst onto the college basketball scene with a run to the round of 8 in 1999, this is just the second time it has reached the Final Four. The Zags lost in the title game to North Carolina in 2017. They were agonizingly close in 2015 and 2019, losing in a regional final. And another opportunity was lost to the pandemic last season, which the Zags concluded with a 31-2 record and a No. 2 ranking in the final Associated Press Top 25 poll.,Much as Gonzaga Coach Mark Few has tried to keep his players on assignments and responsibilities that come with each game plan — something they have largely adhered to — freshman Jalen Suggs admitted that with two games left, his team has eyes on the possibility of an undefeated season, which has not been accomplished since Indiana in 1976.,“It’s hard not to think about it,” Suggs said. “We try to keep our minds off of it and keep focused on the task at hand.”,On this night, though, it all came so easily — just as it has throughout the tournament.,Gonzaga, which has had one game closer than double digits all season, has cruised past Norfolk State, Oklahoma, Creighton and U.S.C. with no game closer than 16 points.,The Zags were so unencumbered on Tuesday that Drew Timme, the mustachioed, headband-wearing sophomore center from Dallas, seemed to go through his entire catalog of flexes after scoring — showing off a bicep, twirling his finger or shaking his head after tossing in a jump hook over Evan Mobley, suggesting that the Trojans’ lithe 7-foot freshman could not guard him.,For one night, he was not wrong. Mobley is likely to be one of the first players picked in the 2021 N.B.A. draft but he had little success trying to thwart Timme, who plays with patience and a surfeit of post moves.,Timme set the tone for the thumping just moments into the game, when he stripped U.S.C. point guard Tahj Eaddy of the ball at one end and drew a foul from Mobley at the other after pump faking him into the air. He scored 13 of Gonzaga’s first 23 points. In all, Timme finished with 23 points, 5 rebounds, 4 assists and 3 steals.,“It set the tone that, hey, we’re going to be aggressive,” Few said of Timme’s steal. “This thing’s going to start with defense.”,The only moment the Zags’ momentum was slowed was a sobering one. Referee Bert Smith collapsed in front of the Gonzaga bench after he had run down the court. He pivoted in the corner and then keeled over, his head hitting the floor with a thud.,Paramedics rushed to attend to Smith, who remained breathing while lying on his back. As Few huddled his players to the side of the court, guard Joel Ayayi and assistant coach Tommy Lloyd peeked over to check on Smith, who was eventually carried off on a stretcher. He was alert and stable and was not taken to a hospital, an N.C.A.A. spokesman said. He was replaced by an alternate referee.,When play resumed — with the score 11-4 in favor of Gonzaga — so did the beat down.,The game had seemed to promise some intrigue: pitting the most proficient scoring team inside the 3-point arc against the team most adept at defending within it.,U.S.C. is one of the tallest teams in the country with the Mobley brothers, Evan and Isaiah, standing 7-foot and 6-foot-10 being flanked by 6-foot-8 Drew Peterson and 6-foot-7 Isaiah White. The Trojans’ zone defense all but forms a picket fence around the basket. But for all their height, the Trojans do not handle the basketball particularly well and Gonzaga repeatedly doubled Evan Mobley and stripped other Trojans of the ball.,Those steals, six in the first half, sent the Zags off and running, leaving U.S.C. Coach Andy Enfield fuming at his players and then the referees, wondering what became of the team that had routed Drake, Kansas and Oregon on its way to a regional final for the first time in 20 years. Gonzaga led 49-30 at halftime.,The second half was spent largely running out the clock, which expired just as fans on the West Coast were sitting down to eat dinner.,The schedule is made largely by the networks that broadcast the games, CBS and TBS. Tuesday’s games were broadcast on the cable network. TBS spokesman Jay Moskowitz declined to explain why the Zags were put in the early game, which began when much of the country — including the entire West Coast — was still at work.,Both games featured a team from the Los Angeles market, but the networks often prefer to put U.C.L.A. in prime slots — as they have in all five games the Bruins have played. And with a No. 1 seed like Michigan, which has a national following, it may have been a predictable decision.,Not that it bothered Few. He said, simply and seemingly without irony, that Gonzaga fans had their priorities in order.,“Trust me, our fans, they’re not at work,” he said. “If you think they’re at work, you don’t know the Zag fans. Everything’s shut down, and everybody was watching.”",sports

According to BMI, “Bridge Over Troubled Water” — first released by Simon and Garfunkel in 1970, and since then covered by artists including Aretha Franklin and Elvis Presley — has had more than five million broadcast performances.,Among the other songs in the collection are “The Boxer,” “Homeward Bound,” “I Am a Rock,” “Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard,” “50 Ways to Leave Your Lover,” “Graceland” and “Mrs. Robinson,” which was featured prominently in the 1967 film “The Graduate.”,Financial terms were not announced.

(Guston died in 1980.),The timing “is urgent because of the art’s relevance to our cultural context today,” Marc Payot, the president of the gallery, said in an email on Wednesday, though he said the show was not organized in response to the postponement of the Guston retrospective at four major museums last year.,Mr. Payot mentioned the “racial reckoning and widespread calls for social justice” after the deaths of , and , last summer, and how they “echo the context in which Guston made these late works.”,Last year, three museums in the United States and one in Britain had delayed programming a Guston retrospective, the first in more than 15 years, that included images with the painter’s motif of cartoonish Klansmen because organizers determined the images needed to be better contextualized for the current political moment.,Though Guston intended the Klan imagery to criticize racism, anti-Semitism and bigotry, organizers said they worried it could upset viewers and that the works could be “,.”,The touring exhibition was supposed to open on June 7, 2020, at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, before moving to the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, then to Tate Modern in London, and finally, to the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. The directors of the museums announced in a joint statement last fall that the retrospective would , — they had , the exhibition until 2024 — and that “additional perspectives and voices” would be needed before the work could be displayed.,Some in the art world called the decision a necessary step back amid the racial justice protests, while , for avoiding challenging works of art.,But the National Gallery had the support of its board of trustees, including Darren Walker, the president of the Ford Foundation, a philanthropic giant. He , in September that if museums had not taken a step back to re-examine the exhibition, it would have appeared “tone deaf.”,“What those who criticize this decision do not understand,” Mr. Walker said, “is that in the past few months, the context in the U.S. has fundamentally, profoundly changed on issues of incendiary and toxic racist imagery in art, regardless of the virtue or intention of the artist who created it.”,Mr. Payot said on Wednesday that Hauser & Wirth had planned its exhibition “for quite some time.” The show will focus on Guston’s figurative paintings and will include works that have never been exhibited before. It will also be accompanied by public programs.,Mr. Payot acknowledged the works were challenging. “But as Guston’s daughter, Musa Mayer, has said, ‘These paintings meet the moment we are in today. The danger is not in looking at Philip Guston’s work, but in looking away.’”,The gallery was still making final selections for the show, but Mr. Payot said that it would include the 1969 painting “Blackboard,” which depicts three hooded Klansmen. He called the painting “an astonishing work, heartbreaking in what it says about the way we teach racism to perpetuate it in America.”,“It’s a rarely seen canvas by an artist at the height of his powers,” he said. “And we are honored to be able to show it.”",arts_culture

She was 88.,The cause was pancreatic cancer, said,, her partner of 64 years and her only survivor.,Ms. Collins, who won her Tony for Herb Gardner’s ,in 1986, was the lighting designer for more than 30 other Broadway productions, among them “The Threepenny Opera,” “Ain’t Misbehavin’” and “Doubt,” which earned her a Tony nomination.,“Her lighting was like her personality: She was nervy and intelligent but with a sensitive side,” ,a Tony-winning scenic designer and frequent collaborator, said in a phone interview. “She really blossomed in tech rehearsals; she loved to create on the spot.” He added: “She could do conventional lighting, but she also wanted to try everything.”,Ms. Collins brought an autumnal palette to “I’m Not Rappaport,” about two irascible and inseparable octogenarians who meet on a Central Park bench, and the darkness of looming death to a 1989 production in Baltimore of , David Feldshuh’s play about the federal government’s withholding of treatment for syphilis to poor Black men. In a 2002 revival of Lanford Wilson’s “Burn This” at the Union Square Theater, she transformed figures onstage into what ,“ambiguous silhouettes.”,She also worked at regional theaters throughout the United States and with opera companies in New York, San Francisco, Santa Fe, London, Paris and Munich — always , to establish moods, create the illusion of time passing and indicate where the audience’s attention should be on the stage.,“Lighting has everything to do with how you feel and how things affect you,” Ms. Collins told The Post-Star in Glens Falls, N.Y., in 1975. “Almost everyone has had the aesthetic experience of being moved by seeing light filtered through trees in the forest. Multiply that by one thousand and you’d have some idea of the constant subliminal effect lighting has on us.”,a lighting designer who worked with Ms. Collins on two productions at the Alaska Repertory Theater in the 1980s, said of her: “She understood the point of the show and made sure that you saw it. Whether it was portentous events in ‘An Enemy of the People’ or the sheer fun of ‘Ain’t Misbehavin’,’ her light reflected and communicated that.”,Mr. Chybowski recalled the lighting design that Ms. Collins devised for “An Enemy of the People,” Ibsen’s political drama about a scientist who tries to save his town from water pollution but becomes a scapegoat.,“She went into the studio, worked at my drafting table for four hours, drew up the plan and went off to the airport,” he said. “I said, ‘It can’t be that easy,’ but we put on the show, and it was the most beautiful show we did in my five years at the theater.”,Patricia Jane Collins was born on April 3, 1932, in Brooklyn to Jerry and Alta (Hyatt) Collins. Her mother worked in a law firm; her father left the family when Pat was very young.,Ms. Collins attended Pembroke College in Brown University, where she studied Spanish and joined a campus drama group. After graduating, she spent a year at Yale Drama School — where she met Dr. Stuermer — but felt it was a waste of time. She went to work instead as a stage manager at the Joffrey Ballet, and then as an assistant to , a top Broadway lighting designer, at the American Shakespeare Festival Theater in Stratford, Conn.,Ms. Collins worked as a stage manager, among other jobs, in the 1960s but did not hit her stride until Joseph Papp, the founder and director of the New York Shakespeare Festival, hired her to design the lighting for productions of ,, which earned her a Tony nomination, and at the Delacorte Theater in Central Park in 1977.,“She had fixed somebody else’s show, and he offered her ‘Threepenny,’” said ,, a lighting designer and longtime associate of Ms. Collins’s. “That put her on the map, and she never stopped working after that.”,For all that she worked on Broadway, she spent much of her time away from it, designing lighting at regional theaters, including Ford’s Theater in Washington, Steppenwolf Theater in Chicago, Berkeley Repertory Theater in California, the Geffen Playhouse in Los Angeles and the Long Wharf Theater in New Haven, Conn.,For the Hartford Stage Company’s production of Shakespeare’s “Cymbeline,” , wrote admiringly of “the ever-changing light patterns” that Ms. Collins had created with “mirror images and stars and moons and comets.”,Ms. Collins, who began listening to opera on radio at age 9, designed lighting for productions at the Metropolitan Opera, the Royal Opera House in London and the Bavarian State Opera in Munich. She also conceived the lighting for Lar Lubovitch’s production of “,” at the American Ballet Theater in 1997.,include “The Heidi Chronicles,” “The Sisters Rosenzweig,” “A Moon for the Misbegotten,” “Good People,” “Orphans” and “Execution of Justice,” for which she won a Drama Desk Award in 1986.,Mr. Beatty recalled being in London one year when Ms. Collins had a double bill of work there — Stephen Sondheim’s “Into the Woods” and a performance nearby at the English National Opera.,At “Into the Woods,” he said, “the curtain goes down, the music starts” and the lighting was “bright and simple, like the world’s biggest flashbulb had come on. Whoa, in your face!”,“There was a certain joyfulness to that,” he added. “Then, she was down the street, doing an esoteric opera, challenging that director to think out of the box. It was perfect Pat.”",arts_culture
